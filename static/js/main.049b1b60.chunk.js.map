As I write this, at the end of July, I am looking out at hazel, willow, cherry, apple,\n                    pear and plum trees, and further away, a huge oak and a row of Douglas firs. A light breeze\n                    is blowing, and a myriad of leaves are oscillating in the wind, safely attached to twigs and\n                    branches. I can hear blackbirds and robins calling, not so urgently now since their fledglings\n                    have left their nests. A pigeon is cooing in the distance.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    This is a world of both change and constancy. Some of the trees in this landscape have been\n                    planted by us humans and others by birds, in a patchwork of forest and pastureland. Some\n                    people think of forests of foreboding places, or even as places of menace. Well, I have never\n                    felt that way, ever since I roamed woodlands as a child, as birds flitted across the green air,\n                    as deer slipped silently by in the distance, as hares nibbled clumps of grass in forest\n                    clearings. I have sought the safety of a forest world since I was little, and even then the\n                    great, lacy canopy of trees conveyed a feeling of awe in me, as it still does today.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>A World Changes</h4>\n                <p>\n                Those of us who live in and around the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest don’t have to be\n                told that these are areas of outstanding natural beauty. In a country that only has about 12\n                percent forest cover they are truly special places. Why can’t much more of the land be\n                covered in forest? Their benefits are obvious: they clean polluted air, absorb carbon dioxide,\n                store and filtrate rain water, prevent soil erosion and supply wood for many uses. They\n                teach us about life on earth. And they offer us wonderful spaces to roam.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Much of the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest look like areas that have been largely\n                unchanged since time immemorial. Not so. Over time, these landscapes have gone through\n                an astonishing variety of adaptations.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The region has been inhabited for millennia, evidenced by remains of megalithic\n                monuments, and ancient hill forts. The Romans arrived at around AD 50, attracted by a\n                plentiful supply of timber, charcoal, iron ore, ochre and lime. The Anglo-Saxons carried on\n                exploiting these precious resources. Then Normans and the thee Tudors used the forest as a\n                hunting ground, whilst also exploiting the forest's fine timber as a ship building material.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From the late 18th century onwards the forest became an industrial region, initially utilising\n                charcoal for smelting the abundant iron ore. Oaks, beech, ash and hazel were coppiced for\n                this purpose, which was a very resilient way of using forest resources as the trees always\n                regrew from the stumps.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Then, in the 19 th century, coal started to be used for smelting the local iron ore instead, and\n                deep coal mines and iron mines, as well as steel, tinplate works and foundries started to dot\n                the landscape. Wood distillation works produced a range of chemicals, and all these\n                enterprises were connected by a network of railways and tramroads. At the start of the 20 th\n                century, competition from more suitable locations elsewhere in the UK gradually reduced\n                industrial activity in the area. The locals were increasingly left to their own devices once\n                more.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>The Locals</h4>\n                <p>\n                The people of the forest have always played their part in any new commercial activity. They\n                supplied the workforce for nobles and kings, and for forest, and mining and industrial\n                enterprises, with only limited benefit to themselves. In addition to any monetary gain they\n                subsisted on crops grown on smallholdings and cottages gardens.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The forest people are masters of a form of traditional permaculture: combining vegetable\n                gardening with growing soft fruit and orchards, and planting edible hedges. Chicken and a\n                pig or two to supplemented their family diet and produced manure. Some people still utilise\n                the ancient privilege of grazing sheep in the forest and on the road verges. These are truly\n                resilient ways of living.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Today, parts of the forest could be described as a model for ‘rewilding’, allowing landscapes\n                to revert to their natural existence with only limited human interference. The wild boar now\n                roaming the Forest of Dean again are a source of meat for some and a menace to other,\n                particularly when they invade household gardens.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>Beauty and Ecology</h4>\n                <p>\n                In the local forests we can experience a living multi-story green landscape reminiscent of\n                Britain’s ancient past. This kind of landscape is reflected in the vivid imagery of Celtic\n                ornaments, in which trees and their branches and leaves are intertwined with all manner of\n                forest animals. Perhaps this is a good way to convey in artistic images what one scientist\n                recently called the ‘Wood Wide Web’.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The forests around us can literally speak for themselves. There are many layers of\n                communication within an intact forest ecosystem that has grown organically over time. It is\n                now well accepted that trees communicate via their root systems and also via the strands of\n                fungi through which they are interconnected within the soil. Natural forests are living\n                superorganisms that have a complex community life of their own.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We should never forget: forests covered much of the planet before humans invented\n                farming and herding some 12,000 years ago. We humans have tended to be a menace to\n                forests. With our chainsaws, bulldozers and tractors we are now better equipped at clearing\n                forests than ever before, converting trees into window frames, into furniture, into toilet\n                paper, into charcoal.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                If they could speak our language, forests would probably tell us that they would rather\n                prefer a world without people. Given half a chance, forests are self-perpetuating places.\n                They will always assure their continuity, as they drop their seeds in late summer, as they\n                shed their leaves in the autumn. The synergy of many living organisms that depend on each\n                other is astonishing to learn about, in the coexistence of a myriad of living beings.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                These days we read much about the plight of tropical rainforests. Here in the UK places such\n                as the Forest of Dean could be called rainforests, too. When we walk in the forest on a rainy\n                day, we may realise that the mist that permeates the forest is an essential part of the forest\n                ecosystem. The moisture that is given off by the trees also keeps the forest alive, and keeps\n                our human communities supplied with water.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                You may say that life is not all about coexistence and cooperation, but that competition is\n                the name of the overarching principle of life on earth– the survival of the fittest and all that.\n                Well when you walk in the forest you certainly see evidence of that, too. You see trees that\n                have died because they have not grown as fast their neighbours and been shaded out by the\n                bigger trees. But maintaining the continuity of life in its interdependent totality is\n                increasingly seen as the key underlying principle of resilient ecological systems.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>Today and Tomorrow</h4>\n                <p>\n                Today, of course, the forest has become a favoured destination for visitors and holiday\n                makers with their SUVs and camper vans, coming over from cities such as Bristol and\n                Gloucester. Cyclists love criss-crossing the green landscape where every turn of the wheel\n                offers a different view.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                For city people, reconnecting with the natural environment and its amazing sights, sounds,\n                and textures can bring a deep sense of relaxation so absent from city life. The term forest\n                bathing – deep immersion in the life of the forest – has become part of the vocabulary of\n                visitors and holiday makers.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And for the forest people, life keeps changing again and again. City people have moved in,\n                buying run-down cottages as a refuge from stressful city life and to bring up families. Some\n                newcomers are welcomed by the locals, others are seen as arrogant intruders.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                What will the future look like? In the coming years more and more people will turn up\n                driving electric cars and bikes. Local resilience will be greatly augmented by the use of\n                renewable energy. Many cottages now feature solar panels, and more wind turbines will\n                make their appearance on the edge of the forest, contributing to the coffers of local\n                communities.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                What is the environmental future of our forests? One concern is the looming issue of\n                climate change. As the world gets warmer, will the vegetation that has grown here for time\n                immemorial still be suitable? Will oak, beech, ash and lime be able to cope with an ever-\n                warming climate?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One thing is clear. With so many changes having occurred over time, landscapes such as the\n                Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest have continued regardless. Ways of live come and go, but,\n                one way or another, continuity prevails. We owe it to future generations that they will have\n                a forest world to enjoy and benefit from as we have.\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Forest","import React from 'react';\nimport './Cities.scss';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nclass Cities extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"cities\">\n                <h3>Sustainable Cities</h3>\n                <div className=\"articlesContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"articleCard\">\n                        <div className=\"articleImage city1\"></div>\n                        <div className=\"articleCardText\">\n                            <div className=\"blockContainer\">\n                                <div className=\"block1\">\n                                    <Link to=\"/articles/cities/sustainability\"><p>Sustainability is unhelpful</p></Link>\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"block2\"><p>| 10th June 2013</p></div>\n                                <br></br>\n                            </div>\n                            <p>This article was published by the Guardian on 10th June 2013.

The world is a dynamic and ever-changing place:\n                        Our own bodies replace their 100 trillion cells every seven years or so. Life is\n                        continuously renewed through the action of great variety of interconnected forces.\n                        Could modern economies operate in a similarly regenerative manner?\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <p>\n                    The term ‘regenerative’ is being used in an ever-greater variety of contexts:\n                    regenerative farming, development, design, nutrition, medicine, economies. I have\n                    written a lot about creating regenerative cities and moving towards circular\n                    economies. Such perspectives are now being articulated in many places, but\n                    meanwhile the essentially degenerative impact of our economic activities on the\n                    world’s living systems continues.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    It is astonishing that current accounting practices still do not factor environmental\n                    externalities into national balance sheets. Governments and companies still tend to\n                    see the destruction of Nature and resource depletion as an inevitable price of\n                    progress, refusing to quantify inconvenient externalities in the price of products. Few\n                    policy makers have been willing to adopt green accounting models to assure a\n                    commitment to maintaining and regenerating natural capital.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    With an ever-increasing understanding of the planetary crisis we are facing, we have\n                    to urgently address this fundamental systems problem. Can we overcome the\n                    selective blindness which allows us to live with the status quo? Can we detach\n                    ourselves from a seemingly irreversible entropic, degenerative, linear, downward\n                    spiral? How can a regenerative approach prevail?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    The crucial issue of environmental externalities has been discussed for decades, but\n                    with only gradual progress being made to deal with it. It is becoming apparent that if\n                    externalities are directly experienced at the local level, there is a good chance that\n                    they will eventually be addressed, particularly where people’s health is at stake.\n                    Relevant examples are effective measures that have been taken to deal with effects\n                    of smoking, asbestos pollution and contaminated drinking water.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    At the wider, national level economists have attempted to quantify the ecological\n                    costs of economic activity since the 1980s. In a pioneering study in 1986, economist\n                    Lutz Wicke costed the environmental damage caused by the West German economy\n                    at 6% of the country’s gross national product. To deal with this damage he\n                    recommended a comprehensive ecological tax reform to help stimulate the\n                    emergence of a regenerative economy. But most of these recommendations remain\n                    on the shelf while many systemic environmental problems remain stubbornly\n                    unsolved.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Climate change, of course is a global systemic externality of an urban-industrial\n                    civilisation relying on vast annual inputs of fossil fuel energy. Yet the world\n                    community still refrains from adopting correct price signals by methods such as cap-\n                    and-trade permits or by direct regulation, sufficient to internalize negative\n                    externalities. But, alas, the very rapid decrease in the costs of regenerative energy\n                    systems such a solar, wind and energy storage technologies is coming to the rescue.\n                    Initially stimulated by feed-in tariffs in Europe and Australia, regenerative energy\n                    technologies are increasingly self-funding as they become cost-competitive with\n                    fossil fuel-based energy technologies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    But even 100% adoption of renewable energy technologies will barely stabilise\n                    global carbon concentrations. Meanwhile the challenge is to stimulate the\n                    greenhouse gas absorption capacity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. But whilst\n                    we discharge ever more C02 into the atmosphere, the capacity of the biosphere to\n                    absorb it is being significantly reduced at the same time. From 1990 to 2015, natural\n                    forests declined from 4.28 billion to 3.99 billion ha, a loss of 290 million ha. Planted\n                    forests increased by 167 to 277 million ha. This may help to meet global timber\n                    demand, which is expected to triple by 2050, but it is not nearly enough to stabilise\n                    terrestrial carbon emissions. Large scale regeneration of both forest ecosystems and\n                    farmland soils is urgently needed to make a significant impact.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Another key, underreported systemic crisis we face is river water contamination\n                    caused by the twin problems of cities not returning the nutrients contained in urban\n                    sewage back to farmland. Meanwhile farmers are forced to replace these lost crop\n                    nutrients by applying artificial fertiliser to their fields instead, with substantial\n                    quantities leaching away into rivers. As a result, there are now some 500 dead zones\n                    in the world&#39;s oceans. Add the fact that we are likely to face phosphate fertiliser\n                    supply shortages in the coming decades, and it is clear how important it would be to\n                    close this particular circle through the introduction of regenerative sewage\n                    technologies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Now another global crisis is receiving much publicity: pollution of the oceans with\n                    plastic detritus is becoming a problem on a similar scale to climate change, but so far\n                    there is little action on the horizon to deal with it. It is becoming evident that this\n                    problem can only be solved by intercepting plastic waste before it enters the marine\n                    environment: Applying innovative recycling technologies that turn plastics – a long-\n                    lived material that is briefly used in short-term packaging – into long-lived products,\n                    such as building materials, bollards, decking, fence posts and garden furniture. But,\n                    again, the right price signals are required to make this possible.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    These three systemic crises can only be addressed by implementing various aspects\n                    of regenerative development. Moving from linear to circular systems, as advocated\n                    by the Ellen McArthur Foundation, has both biological and technical components:\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <h3>Circularity of living systems</h3>\n                    Perhaps the greatest challenge facing us is to turn modern economies and urban\n                    systems from linear into circular modes. Nature operates as an essentially circular\n                    system and invariably all its waste products become sources of new growth: every\n                    output by an organism is also an input which renews the living environment. Can we\n                    organise our economies to fit this model?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Pavan Sukhdev, president of WWF, argues that we need to overcome the problem\n                    of the economic invisibility of Nature. To align economic and ecological systems it is\n                    crucially important to understand that the value of ecosystems services is vast, and\n                    probably more than double the value of the global economy, as estimated by\n                    ecological economist Robert Constanza.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>   \n                    The concept of regenerative development, first and foremost, has to be anchored in\n                    a clear understanding of the integral and interdependent nature of living systems,\n                    with the sun powering all life processes on Earth. Creating regenerative economies\n                    means, above all else, to do everything possible to stimulate the regenerative\n                    capacity of nature by deliberate policies and incentives.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Crucially, we need to develop a comprehensive new understanding of the non-\n                    entropy of living systems: According to quantum physicist Erwin Schroedinger: “Life\n                    seems to be orderly and lawful behaviour of matter, not based exclusively on its\n                    tendency to go over from order to disorder, but based partly on existing order that is\n                    kept up … We must be prepared to find a new type of physical law prevailing in it. …\n                    From all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to\n                    find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics.”\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Similarly, according to the inventor of the concept of general systems theory, Ludwig\n                    von Bertalanffy, “the conventional formulations of physics are, in principle,\n                    inapplicable to the living organism being open systems having a steady state. We\n                    may well suspect that many characteristics of living systems which are paradoxical in\n                    view of the laws of physics are a consequence of this fact.”\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Under the right conditions, biological resources will always tend to renew\n                    themselves, and the inherent regenerative capacity of natural capital, such as\n                    forests, soils and aquatic ecosystems, is evident for all to see. The case for creating\n                    regenerative systems of resource use on land and in aquatic environments, as\n                    essential components of modern economies, is evident. We must surely try and do\n                    everything we can to assure that soils, forests and watercourses are enabled to\n                    continuously regenerate themselves. And specifically, in the case of farming, organic\n                    farming, or regenerative farming, should become the norm rather than the exception,\n                    driven by appropriate policies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <h3>Circular technical systems?</h3>\n                    Modern economies need to be organised to mimic natural systems. But what does\n                    this mean for the technical systems on which so much of the wealth and comfort of\n                    modern civilisation are based? There is a marked difference between the circularity\n                    of biological systems as compared with the challenges facing technical systems. Our\n                    industrial economies are subject to the second law of thermodynamics: the use of\n                    fossil energy, their key ingredient, is an irreversible process. As we power technical\n                    processes, usable energy is irretrievably lost as unusable, dispersed waste. As\n                    energy is made to do ‘useful work’ for us, it inevitably ends up as pollution or\n                    disorder.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Modern urbanisation, intimately connected to economic development, is a major\n                    contributor to this process. Cities are giant heat engines: the energy they require for\n                    their many vital functions can be used only once, as fuels are converted into low\n                    grade heat and waste gases. And as raw materials are processed, their quality also\n                    inevitably deteriorates. Order, established in the form of urban settlements, causes\n                    disorder elsewhere in Nature as products are imported, utilised and discarded.\n                    Concentrating or ordering human activities in high-energy modern cities will tend to\n                    contribute to disorder, waste and pollution. The vast, global ecological footprints of\n                    cities are a case in point.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Between them, modern cities, and the economies they harbour, are ‘entropy\n                    accelerators’ – they downgrade the resources they require in the process of using\n                    them. A key challenge, then, is to find ways to replace high-entropy systems with\n                    low-entropy systems instead. This makes it all the more important to make\n                    renewable energy systems our main sources of energy in the very near future.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Technical systems do not have the inherent capacity to renew themselves in the\n                    same way as biological systems. This is where human inventiveness comes into\n                    play: The waste management mantra of refusing, reducing and recycling, of course,\n                    has been on the green agenda for decades. But there are systemic problems with\n                    this: much recycling is actually downcycling. A loss of quality is inevitable and major\n                    energy inputs are required to power it. Nevertheless, recycling and remanufacturing\n                    of technical products is an important part of a regenerative, green economy.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Again, this is vividly illustrated by the case of waste plastics. In industrialised\n                    countries, urgent action on redesigning packaging, reducing, recovering and\n                    stabilising the markets for recycled plastics through mandatory recycled content is\n                    paramount. All countries need to curb the use of single-use plastics, and to prevent\n                    stray plastics from ending up in waterways and the oceans beyond. The critical issue\n                    is to divert a long-lived material into long-term uses. After a brief use in packaging,\n                    plastics can be ‘put to rest’ in products that they are most suited to: as construction\n                    materials or even in road surfaces. The benefits are all too evident: Cleaner\n                    environments and the creation of a regenerative, green economy. China, as a\n                    booming industrial economy with vast pollution problems, is now beginning to make\n                    significant headway in this direction.

As thinker in residence in Adelaide in 2003 I argued\n                    that a vigorous move towards regenerative development could greatly stimulate\n                    South Australia’s economy. The economic reasons for this are evident: a city region\n                    that takes active measures to improve the efficiency of its use of resource also\n                    reduces its reliance on imported resources – it re-localises parts of its energy and\n                    food economy and brings a substantial part of it back home. These concepts\n                    became the basis for a wide range of new policy initiatives by the government of\n                    South Australia. Today South Australia, a region of 1.8 million people, is a world\n                    leader in solar and wind energy, battery storage of electricity, solar-electric transport,\n                    organic waste recycling and composting, waste-water irrigation, urban-fringe organic\n                    farming and reforestation, etc.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    In my view the wording ‘Regenerative economies for a sustainable world’ is a simple\n                    and effective formula. Regenerative economies are the process and a sustainable\n                    world would be the outcome to strive for. This wording includes the confident use of\n                    the term sustainability, despite some of the baggage now associated with it.

We have the knowledge and the\n                    technologies to make renewable energy our main energy sources. And we urgently need to\n                    regenerate local communities and economies that have fallen by the wayside as economic\n                    globalisation has become a dominant force.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    It follows that only a systemic, rather than a vague compromise approach to future\n                    development will suffice, starting with the realisation that development cannot be at the\n                    expense of the health of the world's ecosystems and that their protection and continuous\n                    regeneration must be a guiding principle for human action.

In an urbanising world, the bulk of\n                    human impacts on the biosphere are from urban production and consumption. Cities are\n                    the primary location of national economic activities. Modern cities are also defined by their\n                    dependence on the use of energy, with the bulk of the world's fossil being burned to power\n                    urban systems. Urban energy consumption and global climate change are intimately\n                    connected.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Much damage has been done to the world's ecosystems already, and urgent solutions need\n                    to be found to reverse it. The time has come for cities to take specific measures to help\n                    regenerate soils, forests and watercourses rather than just sustaining them in a degraded\n                    condition, and to make renewable energy their main sources of energy supply.\n                    Creating a circular rather than a linear urban metabolism – giving plant nutrients back to\n                    nature, storing carbon in soils and forests, reviving urban agriculture, powering human\n                    settlements efficiently by renewable energy, reconnecting cities to the regional hinterland –\n                    these measures are the basis for creating viable new urban economies which are so badly\n                    needed in this time of financial and economic crisis.\n                    Regenerative development is as much about an honest give-and-take between humans and\n                    nature as about reviving human communities at the local level.

As its own farmland grew tired, and as ever more farmers were turned into\n                        soldiers, the insatiable appetite of the metropolis could be met only with foodstuffs grown further\n                        and further afield. North Africa became Rome’s primary supplier of grain, olives and wine.\n                        Freight ships criss-crossed the Mediterranean laden with produce from its colonies.\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                        The role of North Africa as Rome's breadbasket had profound implications in ecological terms:\n                        1) as the region’s forests were turned to farmland, there was a massive loss of tree cover with\n                        erosion and other consequences which are still felt today. 2) the export of grain to Rome was\n                        also an export of plant nutrients, or soil fertility, never to be returned. The soil fertility of much of\n                        North Africa was shoved through the stomachs of the Romans into the Mediterranean Sea.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <p>\n                Rome, before its eventual decline, reached a population of about one million people. At the time\n                it was by far the largest – and most powerful – city in the world. It set patterns of urbanisation\n                still resonating today. Now, 2000 years later, nearly half the world's five billion people live in\n                cities. Never before has urban growth been as rapid as it is now. Everywhere small farmers are\n                leaving – or forced to leave – the land in search of urban livelihoods. Usually relatively self-\n                reliant peasants or herdsman, with traditions of caring for the land that they have inhabited for\n                millennia, are being turned into consumers of cash crops as they adopt an urban lifestyle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We all need food every day, but every meal we eat represents an export of plant nutrients from\n                the land where it came from, never to be returned. And where does the waste go? Well into the\n                sea eventually. This one-way transport of soil fertility, first practised on a large scale by Rome,\n                has now reached global proportions. There are hundreds of dead zones in the estuaries of\n                rivers across the world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 19th century, when London grew by leaps and bounds, the sewage accumulating in the\n                Thames became a huge challenge. The problem was ‘solved’ by building an extensive drainage\n                system – out of sight, out of mind. The sewage was, largely, dumped in the Channel, and not\n                put back on the land. In order to keep the farmland feeding London fertile, guano – bird\n                droppings – were used instead. They were shipped to the UK all the way from Chile.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                When the guano threatened to run out, scientists started to develop artificial fertilisers. Never\n                mind recycling sewage, they reasoned, we can supply mineral fertilisers – nitrate, phosphate,\n                potash – in bags. Subsequently sewage systems in cities all over the world have been designed\n                and constructed as disposal rather than recycling systems. Disposal, not recovery, became the\n                brief of sewage engineers. Thus much of the fertility of the world's farmland that feeds the\n                teeming billions in cities ends up in the rivers and in the sea.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And because sewage is considered a nuisance, not an asset, it may as well be mixed with\n                whatever else needs to be flushed out – cleaning fluids, disinfectants, chlorinated hydrocarbons,\n                heavy metals, and all the other poisons we discharge routinely from our households and\n                factories. The Romans didn't do that, but we do. And add a few million gallons of oil every year\n                and you end up with the kind of potent brew that fish have to cope with in coastal waters all over\n                the world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And then, add fertilisers – nitrates, phosphates and potash – from farmland, of which about half\n                is not absorbed by the food plants but leached into groundwater, and then washed out by\n                streams and rivers into the sea. And then add slurry from factory farms, much of it originally\n                imported as animal feed from distant land – another one-way transport of plant nutrients from\n                farmland to the sea.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>Liquid and Solid Wastes</h4>\n                <p>\n                Ever since the 1960s there has been growing concern about the eutrophication of lakes in\n                heavily urbanised regions of Europe and the US: that is loss of oxygen in surface waters as a\n                result of overfeeding them with plant nutrients. The dire condition of Lake Erie, in particular,\n                made headlines. Since then the problem has not gone away, though the condition of some\n                lakes has been improved by the installation of more sophisticated sewage works and\n                oxygenation systems.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 1980s there is growing concern about the condition of coastal waters. Landlocked seas,\n                in particular, such as the Baltic and the Adriatic, are a real worry. Next on the list is the North\n                Sea where eutrophication now occurs every summer in places such as the German Byte. A\n                proliferation of algae is caused oversupply of plant nutrients from sewage, fertilisers and slurry\n                run-off. The algae act like a sort of poison bait to the fish because of the ever more varied\n                cocktail of toxins with which they are laced. They are heavily implicated in the rapid increase in\n                fish diseases that have been observed in coastal waters in recent years.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Modern cities have a much more complex metabolism than their ancient predecessors such as\n                Babylon, Carthage, Athens or indeed, Rome. Their environmental impact was largely confined\n                to forests (extraction of timber and firewood), soil (export of nutrients, erosion and salinisation)\n                and water (long range aqueducts). But archaeologists won't find any plastics, toxic wastes or\n                radioactive substances in any ancient rubbish dumps they examine.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In contrast, every inhabitant of the modern Western city, with urbanisation rates of up to 80\n                percent, generates around two tonnes of rubbish per year: one tonne of domestic refuse and\n                one tonne of factory waste from the industrial products we purchase. Future archaeologists,\n                investigating the waste dumps of modern cities, will be astonished at the sheer volume and\n                variety of artefacts, as well as the bizarre mixture of materials that we saw fit to use and to\n                dispose of.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Urban and industrial rubbish dumps, piled up over recent decades, pose an environmental\n                problem whose scale is, as yet, inadequately understood. It is becoming quite apparent now\n                that even ‘ordinary’ domestic rubbish is far from harmless. The impacts range from seepage of\n                potentially toxic liquids such as disinfectants, wood preservatives, cleaning fluids, used motor oil\n                and left-over medicines, to corrosion of discarded batteries, and to plastics residue. And waste\n                dumps invariably give off toxic fumes as they catch fire, which they often do.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Factory wastes, an essential ingredient of our consumer lifestyle, are often deposited in the\n                same dumps as household rubbish and greatly add to their pollution potential. In one part of the\n                United States, in New Jersey, where the content of waste dumps is being investigated closely,\n                hundreds of mixed waste dumps have been found to leach all manner of potent poisons into the\n                groundwater. In Germany and Britain similar problems have been unearthed.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>The Age of Fire</h4>\n                <p>\n                Air pollution, too, is predominantly a problem of modern urban/industrial society. Coalmining,\n                when it got into full swing in the 19th century, made available unprecedented quantities of\n                carbon compounds for the purposes of combustion. As fire was tamed into motion power, it\n                came to replace muscle power in most heavy duty-applications, such as traction, transport,\n                manufacturing and farming.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Perhaps the most significant environmental impact of our urban/industrial civilisation is the\n                large-scale transfer of carbon from geological deposits into the atmosphere, in the form of\n                carbon dioxide. By the late 1980s, the CO2 content of the year had increased from the previous\n                265 to 345 ppm, or by 30 percent, going up by 1.5 ppm every year. This doesn't sound that\n                much but few atmospheric scientists now doubt the reality of the greenhouse effect and its\n                likely, dramatic global environmental impacts in the 21st\n                century.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But right now it is the other by-products of combustion which are the most immediate cause for\n                concern: notably sulphur and nitrogen oxides.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 1980s it became increasingly clear that air pollution was by no means a problem of the\n                past as had been assumed after the worst urban smogs had been tackled by clean air\n                legislation that had been passed Britain and elsewhere. Fires in individual households had been\n                replaced by remote power stations with tall stacks fitted with dust filters, and this was thought to\n                be the solution to the air pollution problems of the industrialised countries. But not so: By the\n                early 1980s the horror stories of dying trees were beginning to hit deadlines, from Germany, to\n                Poland to Czechoslovakia. Most European countries reported serious damage to forests, with\n                the statistics showing a further decline every year.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Sulphur dioxide from power station and factory chimneys, as well as nitrogen oxides from these\n                chimneys and from car exhaust pipes, were implicated as the main culprits. In addition, some\n                3000 new man-made gases in trace quantities were identified as part of the cocktail of\n                pollutants in the air we all breathe. All living beings in the northern hemisphere are now exposed\n                to these waste gases to varying degrees.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Throughout the industrialised countries millions were spent researching the chemistry of trace\n                gases, their reactions with each other, their persistence in the atmosphere, and their impact on\n                the sensitive tissue of living matter. A further environmental problem was the erosion of the\n                ozone layer right at the top of the atmosphere by gases such as CFCs used in various industrial\n                applications. All of these are ingredients of the urban, convenience-oriented lifestyle which we\n                have come to take for granted.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <h4>Closing the Circle</h4>\n                <p>\n                The metabolism of modern cities as manifested at present – its throughput of foodstuffs, forest\n                products, fossil fuels and mineral resources – is demonstrably disruptive of the planet's life\n                support systems. Nevertheless, global urban-industrial development is accelerating as never\n                before. Less environmentally destructive traditional lifestyles, based on long established\n                sustainable practices of farming and renewable energy use, are everywhere under attack.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But fortunately, growing minorities of urban people are becoming increasingly aware of the\n                boomerang effect of our modern lifestyles. It is becoming apparent that we are on a collision\n                course with all the life support systems of our home planet. It is becoming clear that all our\n                futures are at stake, and self-interest is kicking in as a powerful motivating force for change.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The process of urbanisation and industrial development is likely o continue across the world, but\n                how can its destructiveness be curtailed?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The most profound problem we are up against lies in the linearity of the development processes\n                we are engaged in. Nutrients are taken from the land as food is grown, never to be returned.\n                Trees are felled for building materials or pulp, and all too often forests are not replenished. Raw\n                materials are extracted and processed into consumer goods which end up as rubbish which\n                can’t be beneficially reabsorbed into living nature. Fossil fuels are extracted from rock strata,\n                refined and burnt and thus released into the atmosphere. All in all, our present civilisation is\n                vastly accelerating the process of entropy with, as yet, hardly imagined consequences for the\n                future of life on earth.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To undo the damage already done, and indeed, to prevent further ravages, a great leap of the\n                imagination, and a profound act of collective willpower is called for. For some years, the ecology\n                movement has done much to draw attention to the issues at stake and few people can claim\n                ‘that we didn't know’.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cities are for people and it is all of us who have to realise that our future, or more precisely that\n                of our children, is in jeopardy. To make cities and urban living ecologically viable is thus\n                becoming an utmost priority. All living beings are profoundly engaged in securing the future of\n                their offspring, and it is time that an urban humanity does the same.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The slogan of the 'greening of the cities' has been catching on in recent years, but all too often it\n                is meant mainly to create more green spaces, i.e., to improve the look of the urban fabric. It is of\n                course important to create a pleasant, greener, urban environment for people to live in. But that\n                can only be the start.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                It will be crucially important to fundamentally reorganise the metabolism of cities – the\n                throughput of raw materials, energy, consumer goods and the treatment of wastes – from the\n                perspective of long-term ecological viability. We cannot afford to continue with a pattern of linear\n                input and output which makes the routine generation of poisonous wastes a 'normal' activity.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                This is not the place to go into technical or organisational detail as regards the reorganisation of\n                the urban metabolism.

Unlike with plants and\n                        animals, our impacts on the global environment transcend the purely biological context,\n                        depending on who we have become regarding our technological and cultural development. In\n                        ecological terms, a hunter-gatherer or a peasant farmer is not the same creature as a member\n                        of an urban-industrial society. And we seem to find it hard to make up our minds whether we\n                        regard ourselves as part of nature or as supra-natural beings, not really knowing where nature\n                        ends and where culture starts.\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                        This situation is vividly illustrated when we look at the statistics of our energy consumption: It is\n                        reckoned that by the 1960s every European used at least 80 ‘energy slaves’, the energy\n                        equivalent to the muscle power of 80 strong men using hand tools. Of course, this energy is\n                        mostly supplied by fossil fuels. The rest of the world is aspiring to similar levels of per capita\n                        energy consumption. In developing countries, fossil fuels use is invariably increasing as part of\n                        economic and urban growth. The decolonialisation of Third World countries is speeding up\n                        industrialisation in the quest for greater affluence, and demands redistribution of the world's\n                        resources of which we consume such an unequal share.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"blackLine\"></div>\n                <p>\n                But what about our environmental impacts? If we consume 80 times as much energy as our\n                ‘natural' ancestors, each of us has as much environmental impact in one year as they had in 80\n                years. We’d better think carefully about our actions, particularly those that affect the\n                environment in irreversible ways. Surely this is a persuasive argument for keeping built-in on\n                obsolescence out of our buildings and our settlements.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Our current lifestyles are possible only by us grabbing deeply into the pockets of other nations\n                and of future generations. The latter can't fight back, but the former – as liberation wars and raw\n                material cartels have shown – will now want to supply raw materials to us on their terms,\n                potentially with considerable consequences for Western levels of production and consumption.\n                After the oil crisis of 1973, the precarious state of Western economies is witness to the changing\n                balance of world economic power. In the USA, President Carter's energy-saving program, and\n                the demand by Third World nations for a new world economic order, are two sides of the same\n                coin. It could significantly reduce inequality between nations, with the potential for substantial\n                impacts on global economic development patterns.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cultures that consume 80 times the energy available to them from sustainable natural sources\n                must surely be living on borrowed time. We mut should revise the ingrained concept of\n                seemingly inevitable economic growth, and take the idea of creating steady-state economies\n                seriously. This certainly has major implications for employment and production patterns.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The sustainability of our lifestyles and of our settlements must surely be high on the list of our\n                priorities. It seems to me that it is high time to shed our short-term priorities for long-term,\n                ecologically defined perspectives. The only way we can do justice to future generations is to\n                define ways of using resources in ways that will be of long-lasting benefit. This means building\n                settlement structures which future generations will be glad to inhabit and to inherit from us.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In which way, then, should ecological considerations influence settlement planning? First of all,\n                this means no longer being subservient to short-term profit and loss accounting criteria, ignoring\n                the wasteful use of non-renewable resources. And it also means assuring a 'closer fit’ between\n                a given culture and its geographical and climatic setting, prioritising the use of local ‘income\n                energy’ sources over reliance on precarious, long-distance energy supplies.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ecological impact of a given culture is above all else determined by its 'metabolism', its\n                throughput of resources, and therefore resource productivity is a crucial factor. But productivity\n                planning is not ‘neutral’: ecological impacts are strongly influenced by the underlying ideology of\n                production, i.e., production for quick profit versus production for long-term use value. The latter\n                must surely gain in strategic importance.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                Ecological development planning cannot flourish in a vacuum. It must take the status quo as a\n                starting point, including prevailing employment patterns, production levels and settlement\n                structures. Even if we bring about a rapid reduction of our level of energy consumption and\n                productivity, our impacts on the global environment and future generations will continue to be\n                massive. We must therefore urgently focus our attention above all else on planning and\n                investment decisions that are likely to have long-lasting ecological and social benefits. We must\n                develop and propose plausible alternatives, and then appeal to the public for support.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To some extent the Town and Country Planning Association is already doing this. It has put\n                innovative concepts for settlement planning firmly on the public policy agenda. As people\n                demand more sustainable homes and more space to exist on, it should make sure that\n                ecological concepts are seen as a non-negotiable frame of reference. In this context the Garden\n                City guidelines proposed by Ebenezer Howard and championed by the TCPA are still highly\n                relevant. His ideas on the more even distribution of the population on a given land surface are\n                implicitly ecological, and are relevant today as much as they were 70 years ago.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The question who we humans are in ecological terms is closely linked to the places where we\n                live and, and how we live in them. The need for our settlements to be sustainable as regards\n                our use of energy and raw materials should be regarded as non-negotiable, embedding\n                development and settlement planning in the context of global ecological and economic\n                relationships. There are surely limits to our use of resources, and particularly energy resources.\n                In particular: can urban planners look to the prudent use of income energies (sun, wind, hydro,\n                geo-thermal, biofuels) as the predominant energy supply for our settlements?\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Ecology","import React from 'react';\nimport './Energy.scss';\n\nclass Energy extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <p>Energy and Economics</p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Energy","import React from 'react';\nimport './Books.scss';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nclass Books extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"books\">\n                <h3 className=\"bookTitle\">Books</h3>\n                <div className=\"booksContainer\">\n                <div className=\"bookCard\">\n                        <div className=\"bookImage book1\"></div>\n                        <div className=\"bookCardText\">\n                            <div className=\"blockContainer\">\n                                <div className=\"block1\">\n                                    <h4>Creating Regenerative Cities</h4>\n                                    {/* <Link to=\"/books/earthrise\"><p>Chapter 4 - Amazonia Ablaze</p></Link> */}\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"block2\"><h4>| 2014</h4></div>\n                            </div>\n                            <p>This book argues that whilst humanity is building an urban\n                                future, urbanisation in its current form is threatening the very future of humanity and the natural\n                                world. Its key premise is that sustainability is not enough.

Brasilia was celebrating Independence Day. Hundreds of\n                thousands of people were lined up along the central boulevard, Avenida Luis Vargas: black,\n                brown and white, shoeshine boys, office clerks, government officials and street vendors. On\n                their separate stand, away from the crowds, stood army officers, decorated for wars they\n                had never fought. The president himself in his ceremonial uniform saluted his troops. Brass\n                bands were playing rousing music as tanks and armoured vehicles rumbled by on the\n                asphalt and fighter planes and helicopters flew in formation overhead, releasing multi-\n                coloured smoke. There was a carnival atmosphere as the people, once again, celebrated\n                Brazil's independence from the country's former colonial masters, the Portuguese. Small\n                children, sitting on their fathers' shoulders, were waving green and yellow paper flags with\n                one hand and eating pink ice cream with the other under the burning sun.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But, meanwhile, so I had been told, the people in the Amazon were celebrating\n                Independence Day in a rather different manner. I wanted to find out how. I was on my way\n                to the Amazon to film a Channel 4 documentary called ‘Jungle Pharmacy.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Early the next morning, I clambered into a Brazilian-made Bandeirante passenger plane to\n                fly to the interior. As soon as the small two-engine plane climbed into the sky the air around\n                us was hazy. There was a veil of smoke between ourselves and the dry land below, which\n                was the cerrado, the savannah country in the heart of Brazil where emus had roamed for\n                time immemorial. Every so often it was criss-crossed by a small river. Strange green circles\n                were dotted across the landscape. They were irrigated fields of soya beans and sugar cane,\n                my neighbour told me; the land of the emus was becoming farming country.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A steward emerged from the cockpit and offered us little plastic cups of sweet coffee,\n                cafezinho. He climbed across boxes and baby cots that protruded into the gangway. In\n                addition to the coffee he also passed around feather headdresses and other tokens of\n                indigenous culture for us to buy as souvenirs. The fifteen passengers were an intriguing\n                assortment of nursing mothers, beefy timber merchants, adventurer types and journalists.\n                We communicated as best we could against the drone of the engines of the unpressurized\n                plane. Most people spent their time reading spy novels or sleeping, but I was horribly\n                fascinated by the scene below.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The landscape had changed from cerrado to tropical forest. Great columns of smoke were\n                rising into the sky right across the land, from horizon to horizon. Large areas of forest down\n                there belonged to cattle ranchers now, and the new owners had celebrated yesterday's\n                Independence Day by setting patches of it alight; the 7 th September had been designated as\n                the day for the start of the queimadas, the Amazon forest fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From the plane some large fires were now clearly visible, but as we flew deeper into the\n                interior, the yellow smoke lay thick as a London smog below us. We could no longer see the\n                land, only the contours of hills rose up through the thick blanket from time to time. My\n                neighbour told me that people were clearing land for cattle, for coffee, for sugar cane and\n                for soybeans. Brazil needs to develop, he said, forests are in the way. The sooner they are\n                gone, the better. Isn't that what you did in Europe, in America? Isn't that the way to make a\n                civilization?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After three hours in the air, it was time to land at our first stop-over, some nameless small\n                town carved out of the jungle by loggers, cattle ranchers and gold-diggers. As we made our\n                descent we could see nothing but smoke until we neared the ground. As we landed, there\n                trees were burning like giant torches right next to the dirt airstrip. They looked as though\n                they had been set ablaze just to mark the runway. It was a crazy, sickening sight.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Back in the air on our way to Redencao I could not believe the scale of what was happening\n                below us. The forests were burning everywhere. The smoke became so thick it penetrated\n                even the cabin of the plane. Some of the passengers started coughing and there were tears\n                running down their cheeks, their eyes burning with the acrid smoke. These were not tears of\n                anger about such immeasurable destruction of the forest below us; most people did not\n                seem overly concerned, except when one of the babies almost seemed to choke. The pilot\n                climbed as high as he could, given the plane's lack of a pressure cabin, up and away from the\n                smoke. I tried to read a book but I could not concentrate. It was a truly nightmarish scene.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After another couple of hours, it was time to land again. The plane took another dive down\n                through the smoke, down into the burning forest to unload men and boxes at a frontier\n                town called Conceiccao do Araguaia. What was their business here? Were they cattle\n                ranchers who had ordered their men to set even more of the forest ablaze? Were they on\n                their way to stake out a mining claim?\n                <br></br>\n                One more take-off and we were on our way to our final destination, Redencao, another\n                hour's flight. The smoke was thicker than ever and I went into the cockpit to ask the pilot\n                whether he'd seen it as bad as this before. He stared at the inquisitive foreigner, but was\n                polite and helpful, nevertheless. Yes, he said, he had, but not for hour after hour like today.\n                He still remembered when this was just a sea of green, with only the occasional Indian\n                village in a jungle clearing. But the Amazon was changing. We had taken seven hours to get\n                here, including our time on the ground. The air had been thick with smoke all the way. No, it\n                wasn't fun flying in the Amazon these days, he said. It was getting too dangerous, there was\n                too much smoke. Too many people were burning too much forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The pilot excused himself. After all, he had a plane to fly. And now he was diving down\n                through the smoke once more on our approach to the airstrip at Redencao. But there was a\n                problem – he could not find it in the smoky air. He circled and crossed through it and back,\n                flying as low as he could, but there was no airstrip in sight, only burning trees and land on\n                fire. This was truly a nightmare landscape, an inferno of unbelievable proportions. Anger\n                was welling up inside me such as I had never felt before. We were witnessing an ecological\n                holocaust, right there a few hundred feet below us, and what could we do about it, except\n                observe it, take pictures of it and try to tell the world? The Earth's greatest storehouse of\n                plants and animals was being incinerated as though it was no more than a pile of dry logs.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Later, I was to learn that in those few weeks of September 1988 some fifty million acres of\n                forest and grassland were on fire, some 10 per cent of Brazil's Amazon region. Back in\n                London I phoned an American astronaut, Dick Covey, who had been circling the Earth in the\n                American space shuttle during those days. He told me that the whole of South America was\n                covered by a blanket of smoke. Nobody, no pilot, no astronaut, nobody in the world had\n                ever seen anything like it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At last our pilot found the airstrip. We dived through the smoke to a nerve-racking but\n                perfect landing. We had arrived. As I drove through Redencao, the town was so thick with\n                smoke that the taxi driver had to put the headlights on, even though it was early afternoon.\n                There was a concert of car horns in the streets of this Wild West town as drivers made sure\n                to avoid each other. They were driving through this infernal landscape as if blindfolded.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The other members of the film crew were waiting in a small hotel. They had gone ahead in\n                another plane. For hours we talked about nothing but the gigantic fires and the smoke-filled\n                landscape. We had intentionally come here at the time of the queimadas, but what we were\n                seeing was obscene beyond imagining.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Redencao was a frontier town straight out of a Wild West movie, Brazilian style. Most of the\n                houses were nailed together from wooden planks. Only in the centre were there stores,\n                bars and large villas that had a sense of concrete permanence about them. The people\n                walking the streets did not give the impression that they were perturbed by the smoke.\n                Even the few Indians we met seemed unconcerned, going about their normal business.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Next day, as we drove out of Redencao, we could see the transformation the Amazon\n                landscape was going through, a transformation quite deliberately planned by the Brazilian\n                generals over twenty years previously. Wherever the road led, trees were being cleared on\n                both sides. There was smouldering forest everywhere, stumps of trees grotesquely\n                projecting up out of the ash-covered soil.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some standing trees were still burning, with flames shooting out of the branches high up in\n                the sky. An eerie silence was interrupted only by the sound of explosions, as pockets of air\n                expanded and tree trunks burst. Here and there cattle with humps were wandering about\n                aimlessly in the blackened landscape, looking for grass. The fence posts on their pasture had\n                burned down and they had escaped, clearly bewildered by the fires and the smoke. One was\n                limping badly, her hoof apparently singed. Up in the sky, groups of screeching parrots were\n                flying about where only a couple of days ago there had been the crowns of trees, fruit trees,\n                nesting trees. But they were gone, reduced to ashen traces on the smouldering soil.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And all of this devastation had been wreaked in the name of development. 'Land for people\n                for people without land', that was the government slogan that started it all. But there was\n                not much evidence of peasants and small farms. The last great untouched forest region on\n                earth was being turned into a giant cattle ranch. Never mind that the thin soil was not really\n                suitable for grass. And never mind that the land, when it was still forest, had actually been\n                inhabited by people, other people, forest people who had been living here for tens of\n                thousands of years. Oh, but they were 'primitive' people, weren't they? They were not\n                worthy of survival in a new world of chain saws and sawmills, refrigerated trucks and\n                hydroelectric dams.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Out of the smoke a small town emerged, made up only of huts nailed together from\n                mahogany planks, one of hundreds like it across Amazonia. Gold had been found and people\n                had flocked in from far and wide. They were mostly men, mostly young men with haggard\n                faces looking with suspicion as the minibus full of gringos stopped outside a bar. What were\n                we doing here, anyway? Inside, beer sold at two dollars a bottle and plenty of it was being\n                drunk. A few of the men had mouths full of gold teeth, and fat bellies. They were drinking\n                spirits, and looked at us even more suspiciously than the rest. One of them pulled a handful\n                of small nuggets out of his pocket. Did we want to buy some gold? No thanks, we are only\n                passing through.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The road was full of deep holes and the suspension of the minibus was less than adequate,\n                not to mention the steering. The driver proceeded, nevertheless, as though he were on a\n                racetrack and we held our breath each time we crossed one of those narrow tree-trunk\n                bridges. In several places, smouldering forest giants were lying across the dirt road and we\n                had to screech to a halt. Since it was impossible to move them and as we had no time to\n                wait until they had turned into ash, we were forced to cut holes in the cattle fence with wire\n                cutters, and to drive over the ash-filled pasture until the dirt road was passable again.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Suddenly there was a chain across the road and a sign announcing the Gorotire Indian\n                Reserve. A man came out of his hut, an Amerindian with long black hair. He was wearing\n                shorts and a T-shirt like the Indians we had seen in Redencao. He was on guard duty. After\n                we had explained that we had come to film with the Kayapo, he went back to the hut to\n                consult with another man. Then he dropped the chain and let us through.\n                The road narrowed and became more winding. Soon we realized we had come to a different\n                world. Here, for the first time on our journey, we saw the colour green. There were tall trees\n                and it was shady and quite cool. Trees covered in vines, orchids and all kinds of epiphytes\n                rose up on both sides of the track. No two trees seemed alike. Birds were singing and flying\n                about, howler monkeys were shouting at us. There was still smoke in the air, but for the first\n                time for hours there were no fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Gorotire is a village made up of modern brick houses. It was not arranged in a circle like\n                traditional Indian villages, but had been built along a central track. The Kayapo in Gorotire\n                live in a world somewhere between ancient and modern. They still wear feather head-\n                dresses, but they also wear white man's clothes. They still paint their faces and bodies, but\n                their brightly coloured glass beads are imported from Czechoslovakia.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Kayapo greeted us with generous smiles. I had met some of them in Brasilia. The three\n                Gorotire chiefs, Kanhok, Ute and Totoi, and some of the village warriors had been active in\n                the campaign for proper constitutional rights for all Indians. They had stayed in a mission\n                school in the capital and had been driven to the House of Parliament every day to\n                participate at a convention to draw up a new constitution for the country. They had even\n                led lobby discussions, determined at long last to be granted full rights of citizenship in their\n                own country. They had done so in their unique style, chanting and dancing outside\n                parliament clad in their jungle best, their heads dressed in multi-coloured parrot feathers.\n                They had looked magnificent in the air-conditioned lobby of the Hilton Hotel, in a world\n                usually inhabited only by men in grey lightweight suits.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Now, in Gorotire, they greeted us with great warmth. They had been expecting us. We were\n                invited to the men's house and I was given a chance to explain the purpose of our visit to\n                everybody. The documentary we were making was concerned with the Indians' knowledge\n                of the forest and its medicinal plants. Our purpose was to ascertain whether the Indians\n                really were the great experts in forest ecology and in medicinal plant remedies they were\n                reputed to be by some anthropologists.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup, the shaman we had come to film with, did not live in one pf the modern houses.\n                He preferred a traditional straw and mud hut away from the centre of the village. He\n                welcomed us with the detached curiosity of an old man who had seen many changes in his\n                life. He had the silver-haired looks of a Harvard professor, but he also wore large hoops of\n                glass beads in his ears.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The evening was for dancing and celebrations in which the whole village took part. We were\n                fed a delicious meal consisting of fish, bananas and manioc, steamed in banana leaves. But\n                somehow we were not in a party mood after seeing all those fires: they had reached to\n                within fifteen miles of Gorotire.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The next morning, we got our equipment ready to film with Beptopup, who had said he\n                would take us take us downriver into the forest to show us his medicinal plant garden. Dr\n                Elaine Elisabetsky, director of the school of ethno-pharmacology at Belem University, had\n                visited Beptopup many times before to learn about his use of forest plants. She brought\n                Beptopup and his granddaughter down to the boat. For half an hour we canoed down the\n                Fresco River along banks covered with tall trees. The water was not crystal-clear, as one\n                would expect, but brown with soil from a nearby gold mine. After half an hour in the canoe,\n                we stopped at a small landing stage.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We followed Beptopup along a narrow forest path. He walked like a young man as he\n                ducked below branches, picking the leaves of plants and wild passion fruit dangling off the\n                trees. The forest interior was full of the sorts of plants that decorate living rooms back home\n                in London or New York: cheese plants, wild pineapple, heliconias, all kinds of orchids, plants\n                with beautifully coloured leaves, and what we call ‘rubber plants’. They are at home in the\n                moist shade of the forest, which has a constant temperature of some twenty-six degrees\n                centigrade all the year round. The forest is surprisingly cool, but once it is removed, the\n                daytime temperature shoots up to thirty-five or forty degrees under the fierce tropical sun.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup was in the world he had always known, the forest world of his ancestors. It just\n                happened to be one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. But as anthropologists had\n                established, he and his people knew virtually every living thing in their familiar world. In\n                fact, ehnobiologists from European and American universities who had studied his\n                knowledge, and that of other shamans of Amazonian tribes, had found that they had a\n                name for every plant in the forest and a use for most. And why not? The Amerindians have\n                been in the Amazon for tens of thousands of years, plenty of time to experiment with the\n                use of plants for food and medicine.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One does not need scientific instruments to learn about the world; our senses; the capacity\n                of our six senses and the knowledge systems passed on from generation to generation will\n                do. Now, at the very moment that many of the forest tribes had been almost wiped out,\n                people are beginning to realize that these are not 'primitives', but world experts on the\n                fauna and flora of the rainforest who have a great deal to teach humanity if we want to\n                utilize the biological resources of the living forest intelligently.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup understood that we had not come with chain saws and bulldozers like white men\n                usually do, but that our film camera was there to record his forest science and to show the\n                world how his knowledge was profoundly relevant to humanity. Many plants have medicinal\n                uses yet to be explored by modern science. We had not come to tell him and his people\n                what to do, but to listen and to learn. Beptopup's profound familiarity with the world\n                around him was amply illustrated as we walked along together through the green shade of\n                the forest. He unselfconsciously spoke with his granddaughter, Bekwaiti, quietly touching\n                and teaching her the names of plants we encountered on our way deeper and deeper into\n                the jungle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After an hour's walk we reached his forest garden. American ethnobiologist Dr Darrell\n                Posey, who spent much time in Gorotire, had told us that it was here that Beptopup had\n                lived for many years of his life with his wife and children away from the village. In the 1960s\n                his fellow tribesmen had threatened to kill him because he could not come up with\n                medicines against the new diseases the white men had brought to the village and which\n                were decimating the Kayapo. He, the shaman and medicine man, was expected to know\n                how to cure all diseases known to them, but now he had no medicines against new diseases\n                like flu, meningitis, TB, whooping cough, measles, polio and virulent strains of malaria. It had\n                all happened so suddenly and there was no time to experiment with forest medicines.\n                Beptopup decided to escape from the anger of his people and to live away from the village.\n                And so he packed his bags and hammock, and he and his wife and children moved away ·\n                deep into the forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some seven years later, he left his forest garden and went back to the village so that his\n                children could be named in the proper ceremony. The tribe welcomed him back because he\n                knew plant remedies that would stop the women from having babies. Many women did not\n                want babies any longer, they said, because the white man was taking the land away from\n                them. They did not want to live in a world without forests, without shade, without birds and\n                monkeys. Could he come and administer the contraceptive remedies?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And Beptopup stayed in the village and gave the women the seeds of a particular orchid,\n                and a brew made from the bark of a special tree, and for many years few babies were born\n                in the village. Cattle ranchers burned more and more of the forest nearby and gold-diggers\n                came and carved deep holes in the ground and dumped sludge full of mercury in the Fresco\n                River. The fish were poisoned and people became ill from swimming in the muddy water.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But the Kayapo, unlike other tribes in the Amazon, were warriors. One day they decided\n                they were no longer going to be messed around, that they would rather die than lose their\n                forests and their dignity. After years of suffering, they took their destiny in their own hands.\n                They brought warriors together from several other villages and one day in 1985 they\n                stormed the gold miners' camp. With war clubs and spears and a few guns they drove the\n                miners into a large shed and locked the doors. They then radioed the Brazilian government\n                and insisted on having their land demarcated before they would release the miners. And\n                they wanted it – now!\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And that is what actually happened: within a few days the Brazilian government, after years\n                of inaction, flew in land surveyors and actually demarcated the Gorotire reserve. The\n                Kayapo chiefs negotiated for a share of the gold mine, since they knew they could not get\n                rid of it. After contracts were formally signed, the miners were released by the warriors,\n                who went back to their villages. For the first time in years the Kayapo had some control over\n                their own destiny and could be more optimistic about the future. Today there are many\n                children again in Gorotire. And at night around the camp fires, they are often told the\n                stories of the great victory of the Kayapo over the gold miners and the government.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup's forest garden was an outcrop of granite rocks several hundred metres across. In\n                the cracks between the rocks, soil had accumulated and this is where he had planted his\n                medicinal plants, remedies his people had used successfully for millennia. He proudly\n                showed us several specimens of an orchid that he had planted (its botanical name\n                Epistephium lucidum), whose seeds he used as the contraceptive he had administered to\n                the women. He insisted: 'Women who take this will have no more babies, no more babies at\n                all. It dries up their wombs, it dries them up completely.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The use of the seeds of this particular orchid as a contraceptive has been confirmed by\n                several anthropologists and one missionary who worked with the Kayapo, though their\n                contraceptive action had not yet been tested scientifically. But weeks after we left Brazil, at\n                the pharmacology institute of the University of Chicago, we were able to film a research\n                student, Karen Lowell, who was testing another contraceptive remedy which Peruvian and\n                Ecuadorian Indians call piri-piri. The grass-like plant had turned out to have a definitive\n                contraceptive effect in trials with laboratory mice. Research into this and other Amazonian\n                contraceptive remedies continues. Meanwhile pharmaceutical institutes and companies\n                across the world are screening thousands of tropical forest plants every year for their\n                medicinal efficacy.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Knowledge of plant medicines used by Amerindians is passed on verbally from generation to\n                generation. Tribal people like the Kayapo know that it is the old people who are the best\n                teachers for the young. All children learn some of the ancient plant knowledge as they grow\n                up, but only a few, like Beptopup, become specialists whose comprehensive knowledge is\n                greatly cherished. The appearance of the white man and his new diseases and new\n                medicines caused so much confusion and uncertainty. Now, shamans like Beptopup have\n                new pupils: ethnobiologists like Dr Darrell Posey who have made tribal knowledge of plants\n                and animals the focus of their research. He has written more than a hundred scientific\n                papers on the Kayapo knowledge system.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                This is what he told us: 'Beptopup for many years has been my guide and my teacher. The\n                gap between our cultures is very large and he has been very patient with me. I think he is\n                aware of the fact that his is the last generation with that degree of knowledge. I have come\n                to realize that his is a systematic knowledge which has developed for thousands and\n                thousands of years. It is very rich indeed. Yes, it is science, and a very complex one at that. It\n                is, in fact, a testable knowledge. If we find that it works we can integrate it into our own\n                scientific context.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Kayapo, who I have studied with, do have plants for controlling fertility, which as we\n                know is an enormous issue all over the planet. But this also raises an ethical issue: we have\n                to find ways to compensate native peoples for the knowledge of medicinal plants which\n                they are contributing. I don't think that we can ethically exploit this knowledge without\n                proper rewards. If we did that it would be nothing more than a form of neo-colonialism, in\n                which we are taking their science, mass-producing it without giving benefits to the native\n                people who are the guardians of that knowledge.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A couple of days after filming in Beptopup’s forest garden, we flew him and his wife to an\n                area outside the Kayapo reserve which had once been their own territory. Now it was by the\n                side of a road full of timber lorries on the edge of a cattle ranch. But Beptopup still\n                recognized the land he had not been back to for fifty years. There were still patches of forest\n                left and Darrell wanted to show us how its species composition was, partly, the result of\n                human presence. The Indians do not leave stone monuments in areas of forest they once\n                inhabited, they leave a modified composition of trees with more fruit and nut trees than\n                areas of 'natural' forest. Such patches of 'modified' forest are clearly identifiable if one flies\n                over the jungle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Down on the ground, Beptopup started reminiscing about the Kayapo village that once,\n                many years ago, existed in this part of the forest. He pointed out medicinal plants that the\n                villagers had planted on the edge of the forest and which were still there. He told us that\n                they were remedies for treating boils, coughs, diarrhoea, and fungal skin diseases. Then, as\n                we stopped filming, we noticed that his wife, Kukein-Kudjai, a woman in her late sixties, had\n                vanished. Soon we saw her right at the top of a Bacaba palm tree, where she was harvesting\n                the bunches of fruit, much to the delight of her husband, who then started making a basket\n                from the palm leaves.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Only a few hundred yards further on, we stumbled up on a smouldering stretch of forest\n                that had been set alight the day before. Beptopup walked around among the blackened\n                stumps in anger and bewilderment, shaking his head again and again. Then he said: 'Why\n                must the white man always destroy everything? Why does he never plant anything? The\n                white man doesn't like the forest, but the forest is good, the forest looks after us. Why does\n                the white man burn the forest and destroy the trees? Where are the turtles going to live,\n                and the birds? How are my children going to live? What are they going to eat? Where will\n                they get their medicines from? Why does the white man hate the forest so much? ... I have\n                said all I want to say, I want to leave.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In summer 1989, I was back in the Amazon to film another documentary for Channel 4 in\n                London, ‘Halting the Fires’. This time our purpose was to find out if and how the Amazon\n                forest holocaust might be stopped.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Never before had the assault on rainforests been as fierce as it has been throughout the\n                1980s. In Brazil alone, an area of virgin forest the size of France has been cleared in the the\n                1970s and ‘80s, some 15 per cent of Brazil's Amazon forests. This does not include the huge\n                areas of forest along the Atlantic coast which vanished during the process of Brazil's colonial\n                conquest. Just three per cent of the Atlantic forest remains. The rest has been annihilated\n                and converted to cattle ranches, soybean farms, and coffee and sugar-cane plantations, and\n                for urban development.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The massive eradication, or 'development', of Brazil's Amazon forest in recent years is the\n                result of deliberate government policy, first formulated by the generals who took over in\n                Brasilia in 1965. At the end of 1966, General Castello Branco unveiled his 'Operation\n                Amazonia' strategy with operatic pomp: he invited 300 of his fellow generals, Brazilian and\n                foreign businessmen, industrialists, bankers and planners on board the pleasure cruiser\n                Rosa de Fonseca for a trip from Manaus up the Amazon. The party discussed the\n                ‘modernization’ of the Amazon.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The fiscal instruments for this purpose were to be tax breaks, land concessions, trade\n                incentives and all kinds of special credits for the developers. Cattle ranchers, logging\n                companies and mining corporations soon took advantage of the sweeteners on offer from\n                the Brazilian government. In order to facilitate the 'development', a massive programme of\n                road construction was initiated. Once the bulldozers had cut deep gashes into the jungle,\n                the trees on both sides could be cut or burned down. Once the forest was incinerated, grass\n                seeds were spread into the ash by the same means. Often hundreds or even thousands of\n                acres were ‘developed’ in one fell swoop.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The opening up of the Amazon resulted in an unprecedented boom, with land values as\n                much as doubling every year. Land in the Amazon became a vehicle for capturing incentives\n                and cheap credits, assuming the form of a speculative instrument rather than being an input\n                into agriculture.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ranchers, loggers and mine developers wanted the Amazon for themselves. But a\n                conflict of interests developed between them and poor migrants. An environmental crisis in\n                the north-east of Brazil and the mechanization of agriculture in the south of the country\n                brought about a flood of peasant farmers to the Amazon in search of the promised land,\n                encouraged by the government. They hoped to have their own small farm, a little house\n                surrounded by mango, avocado, coconut and copuacu trees, a few pigs, a chicken and a\n                cow. They wanted a field for growing subsistence crops like rice, corn, beans and manioc\n                and another for cash crops such as cacao, pepper and papaya.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But the power of the big landowners, combined with lack of capital and marketing problems\n                for cash crops, were the downfall of many a small settler. Some were forced to become\n                cowboys on the big facendas. Others were actually employed as pistoleiros, gunslingers, by\n                the big landowners, invading smallholdings in the dead of night, killing settlers or evicting\n                them by threatening murder. Many failed settlers ended up digging for gold at the vast Sera\n                Pelada mine or in thousands of smaller mines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                It has often been said that the soils of the Amazon are not really suitable for farming and\n                that this is the cause of the failure of many settlers. Tropical soils are usually less fertile than\n                the soils of the temperate zones. The main reason is the high metabolic rate of living beings\n                in the moist tropical climate. In the rainforest, most trees drop a few leaves all the year\n                round and as they reach the ground fungi, caterpillars or herbivores munch them up. Leaves\n                are thus quickly converted back into plant food, which is then rapidly absorbed by the soil,\n                to be used by the roots of trees and shrubs for new growth. Trees actually contain much of\n                the fertility present in forests, and a thick layer of leaf mould never accumulates as it does in\n                temperate forests. Thus tropical forest soils converted into farmland are usually deficient in\n                humus, and settlers find it hard to use them for anything other than tree crops.\n                The conversion of tropical forests into pasture is a particularly questionable enterprise. This\n                becomes abundantly clear when one travels across the Amazon on the dirt roads that have\n                been built since the sixties, as I have done for many months. There are now endless\n                stretches of grassland dotted with the burnt-off remains of trees projecting starkly into the\n                sky. Only very occasionally does one see a cow or, even more rarely, a buffalo. Usually the\n                pastures are neatly fenced, but often the fences enclose scrubland which is neither pasture\n                nor forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Half of the pastures established within the last twenty years or so in the Amazon are now\n                abandoned. In fact, many have never actually seen a cow. Frequently, they were simply\n                used by their owners to attract development subsidies and other kinds of financial support\n                from the government. In twenty years from the 1970s onwards, the Brazilian government\n                paid out no less than six billion dollars in such tax incentives to Brazilian landowners, much\n                of it borrowed from foreign banks. In return, Brazil gained a largely unproductive area of so-\n                called 'pastureland' in the Amazon, approximately the size of France. This astonishing waste\n                of resources was for many years a cornerstone of Brazil's development policy. In addition to\n                the devastation of the environment, other sectors of the Brazilian economy were starved of\n                much-needed development capital.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ruthless and senseless destruction of the Amazon forest throughout the 1970s and\n                1980s could not be kept a secret. Films and reports about the forest holocaust soon led to\n                the formation of pressure groups in Europe and the USA, focusing on the environmental\n                dangers of deforestation in the tropics. Researchers discovered that much of the money\n                spent on 'developing' the region was paid out by the World Bank and other development\n                banks which received their funds from taxpayers in Europe and North America. But few\n                taxpayers were aware how their money was being spent.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Above all, it was road construction which paved the way for cattle ranching as well as\n                mining projects. The BR 364, which was cut from Cuiaba in Mato Grosso through Rondonia\n                towards Rio Branco, capital of Acre, was particularly contentious. The World Bank was\n                forced to reconsider its investment policy when demonstrations in Washington led to\n                enquiries in the US Congress. The bank had actually ignored its own environmentalists, who\n                had warned of the consequences for the virgin forest of the construction of this road. It has\n                since been paved and, although there are already plenty of new potholes, the road is here\n                to stay, facilitating further destruction of the forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Bom Futuro mine in the state of Rondonia is a case in point. A few years ago, rich\n                deposits of tin ore were discovered in this location near Ariquemes on the BR 364. Wildcat\n                miners started prospecting for the ore. The first few arrived on mules, kitted out only with\n                picks, shovels, sacks and rudimentary refining equipment. When the rumour started\n                spreading that there were rich pickings at Bom Futuro (the 'mine of the good future'),\n                thousands followed. A road was bulldozed through the forest. It is a sad irony that the\n                subsequent success of wildcat mines like Bom Futuro made long-established tin mines in\n                places like Cornwall in southern England uncompetitive, forcing them to close.\n                Bom Futuro mine is an astonishing vista. Out of the flowering forest emerges a cratered\n                moon landscape dotted with tents made of black polythene sheets covered in red dust.\n                There are smouldering trees everywhere. Just a few years ago, this was virgin forest. Now\n                25,000 people live here in their makeshift shelters, cutting holes into the ore-rich soil with\n                their pickaxes and shovels. But, increasingly, the operation is being mechanized as the big\n                companies move in. There are any number of Komatsu diggers and Mercedes-Benz lorries,\n                digging up the ore and carting it to processing plants. The miners and truck drivers work\n                around the clock and earn good money by Brazilian standards, but the devastation is\n                appalling and the risks are high.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There are puddles everywhere with swarms of mosquitoes. Just about everybody has\n                malaria. The hospital in Ariquemes is the only one in the world that exclusively treats\n                malaria cases. The hospital director explained why: 'The forest, as an organism, has a\n                defence system. Its defence against devastation are enormous swarms of mosquitoes. We\n                have nearly 300,000 cases of malaria annually. The devastation of the forest should be seen\n                as a political issue.' While we are filming at the hospital, a lorry arrives carrying the corpse of\n                a man who'd been battered to death: a miner who had died in a dispute over mining rights.\n                He was one of about five people killed like that at Bom Futuro every week.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Life in the Amazon comes cheap, for settlers, miners, rubber tappers and Indians alike. In\n                this world of conquest, the original inhabitants are the biggest losers. Road building in their\n                territories invariably results in disease and violent death. Wherever the bulldozers roar\n                through the forests, pushing over trees and levelling hills, Indians are on the retreat. In the\n                past, up to 90 per cent of any given tribe would perish soon after contact. They have no\n                immunity, or indeed traditional medicines, against diseases like measles, TB, whooping\n                cough, polio, meningitis or just the common cold. Until the white man arrived, flu was\n                unknown here. Now it is a killer disease.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Surui chief Itabera told us: 'We never had pneumonia, measles, malaria. When we lived in\n                the jungle we were healthy. After the white man came we started getting sick. One-third of\n                our people have tuberculosis now. That's why we sell our trees to the sawmiller. But he\n                doesn't value us. He just exploits us and our forests.' The same story is told by Indians\n                throughout the Amazon. And where the Indians have not died from disease, many have died\n                from bullets.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In another Amazon state, Para, we went to film the new town of Paragominas. It is located\n                on another new road, the Brasilia-Belem highway. This place has been called the 'sawmill\n                capital of the world'. There are some 500 mills, financed mainly with government grants.\n                They slice up the thousands of trees brought every day along the web of dirt roads cut into\n                the forests. A permanent smoke cloud hangs over the town from sawdust incinerators and\n                charcoal kilns. Over forty species of trees are processed in the sawmills. As they are cut\n                down in the forest, they tear down many other trees with them, because they are\n                connected by a tangle of lianas. The degraded forest dries out much more than virgin forest,\n                with the big trees no longer providing shade. Such forests are an easy prey for fires.\n                Apart from providing high-quality timber cheaply, places like Paragominas also produce\n                charcoal, the new boom industry in the Amazon. It is the sawmill off-cuts that are stacked\n                into the charcoal kilns. The kilns are worked by resettlers from other parts of Brazil. Men\n                and women earn around ten dollars a week, but the majority of the workforce are children.\n                They earn little more than food money. One boy told us: 'I get up at one o'clock in the\n                morning to work the whole day. We have no school, no nothing. We only suffer and work\n                here. The charcoal won't let the children grow. We work and work but we hardly make any\n                money.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Charcoal kilns are proliferating in Amazonia, not just ones burning sawmill off-cuts. In the\n                south of Para, around Maraba, the virgin forest is being cut down to be converted directly\n                into charcoal, thousands of acres every year. Some of the charcoal is used for grilling steaks,\n                but most of it is actually used for smelting pig iron.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Grand Carajas project in Para is the largest iron-ore mine in the world. Brazil has run up\n                a world-record debt – some 120 billion dollars – to set up new industries and new mining\n                operations such as the Carajas mine. It is the richest source of iron ore in the world.\n                Financed by loans from the EU, Japan and the USA, it provides the raw material for steel\n                industries throughout the Western world. Our cars, fridges, washing machines, pipelines\n                and iron girders are now made mostly from ore mined in Carajas, a mountain of iron first\n                discovered when the compasses of planes flying over it went wild.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Brazil's state-owned mining company, Compania do Vale de Rio Doce, developed Carajas\n                into a super-efficient operation. With giant diggers and 180-ton trucks imported from the\n                USA the company is trying to make large profits and to earn hard currency for Brazil. Carajas\n                is the name of the tribe that once lived here, but its remnants have since been settled\n                elsewhere. The naked 'savages' with their bows and arrows were no match for men\n                equipped with guns and giant machines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In order to transport the ore and the pig iron from The Carajas mine, a 200-mile railway line\n                was specially built to the Atlantic harbour of Sao Luis. The actual mine itself is not an\n                ecological disaster area. In fact, the forests around the Carajas mine have been kept\n                relatively intact. But several pig-iron smelters have now been established around the town\n                of Maraba to the west and it is here that the forests are being incinerated. The trees burned\n                in the kilns come into the equation at zero value, a tempting prospect. And thus the world's\n                most unique flora is turned into profane charcoal to smelt iron ore. Brazil has been using\n                money borrowed from our banks to destroy what is, arguably, its most precious natural\n                asset, the Amazon forest, as though it were absolutely valueless. Thus rainforest trees end\n                up providing us with our cars and washing machines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Para is the easternmost state of the Brazilian Amazon. Apart from Rondonia, it is the most\n                ravaged part of the Amazon forest. It is here that cattle ranching first started. And it is here\n                that the largest mining operations are in place, not just for iron ore, but also for bauxite,\n                manganese, copper and gold. It is in Para that huge areas of forest have been flooded by\n                hydroelectric schemes, largest of all the Tucurui dam which powers Carajas and other\n                mining operations. But it is also here that the resistance against further rainforest\n                destruction has been fiercest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A new alliance between scientists, ecological activists and Indians has been forged with the\n                purpose of slowing down and ending the destruction. It was a Brazilian professor, Dr Salati,\n                who first pronounced that the continuing destruction of the eastern section of the Amazon\n                forest could have the most severe climatic consequences. He showed that the rains that\n                come in from the Atlantic first shed their moisture over the forests of Para. This rain is\n                absorbed by the trees, but most of it is released again by evapo-transpiration powered by\n                the hot tropical sun. The moisture rises from the steaming forests and blows westwards,\n                where the clouds shed their load again and again. And so the process is repeated six or\n                seven times until the clouds reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, where they are driven\n                upwards by the cold mountain air. Some of them drift southwards, eventually to fall as rain\n                over Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and even as far away as Europe. Others are blown\n                northwards, to reach as far as Mexico and the wheat belts of the USA and Canada.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Scientists have expressed the fear that further deforestation of Para on the eastern rim of\n                the Amazon forest would be disastrous. Already, there are signs that the rains are falling\n                more erratically and that the dry season is getting longer. The local climate seems to be\n                getting drier; the majestic Amazon clouds appear to be drifting by more and more often\n                without shedding their rain. With ever more deforestation, average soil temperatures are\n                rising as they have done elsewhere on the planet where trees have been cut down on a\n                huge scale, as in Africa and India. At the same time, soil moisture is declining and when the\n                rains do pour down there is much more rapid run-off than from land covered by the multi-\n                layered canopy of trees. In deforested regions, soil erosion is severe, washing precious\n                topsoil into the rivers and polluting waters that once teemed with fish.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Dr James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia theory, is convinced of the critical importance\n                of the Amazon forest for sustaining the beneficial interaction between the biosphere and\n                the atmosphere. He recently estimated the cash value of the environmental services of the\n                Amazon to the planet. He likens the forest to a giant air-conditioner, helping to keep the\n                Earth cool and moist. In a recent lecture he stated:\n                <br></br>\n                ‘One way to value the forest as an air-conditioner would be to assess the annual energy cost\n                of achieving the same amount of cooling mechanically. If the clouds made by the forests\n                reduce the heat flux of sunlight received within their canopies, by only 1 per cent, then their\n                cooling effect would require a refrigerator with a cooling power of fourteen kilowatts per\n                acre. The energy needed, assuming complete efficiency and no capital outlay, would cost\n                annually £2,000 per acre ... On this basis, an accurate but imprecise estimate of the worth of\n                the refrigeration system that is the whole of Amazonia is about £100 trillion.’\n                <br></br>\n                The meat yield of an acre of cleared forest temporarily converted into pasture land, by\n                comparison, is equivalent to about 750 hamburgers annually, for which the rancher is paid\n                about £IO.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The indigenous people of the Amazon have not been slow to respond to the realization by\n                ecologists and climatologists that the maintenance of their traditional way of life had a\n                respect, even a reverence, for the forest, would be a good prospect for the world. The most\n                astonishing manifestation of this new allegiance was an extraordinary gathering at the small\n                town of Altamira in the state of Para. It was here that yet another massive hydroelectric\n                dam had reached the planning stage. The dam would have flooded land traditionally\n                inhabited by the Kayapo, the Arara, the Assurini and several other Amerindian tribes. And it\n                was here that the young Kayapo chief Paulinho Payakan decided to hold a very special\n                meeting in February of 1989.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                I had the opportunity to make a short news film about the Altamira gathering for Channel 4,\n                and so to witness what turned out to be an extraordinary event.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From all parts of the Amazon and from North America, 900 Amerindians arrived. And from\n                Europe, the USA and Brazil, 400 journalists and environmentalists, turned up. The whites\n                came with cameras, tape recorders and word processors. The Indians came with bows and\n                arrows, with wooden clubs, colourful head-dresses, and a few brought their own video\n                cameras.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The only topic on the agenda of the meeting was the future of the rainforest. The forest\n                Indians, threatened with the total destruction of their familiar habitat, had decided to take\n                the future in their own hands.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Never had there been such an extraordinary gathering of Brazilian tribes. The Arara,\n                Xavante, Gaviao, Yanomami, Suya, Guarani, Surui, Parakana and many other tribes sent\n                representatives. They came in buses, by plane and by boat up the Xingu River, all made up in\n                their own distinctive feather head-dresses and body paints. As they arrived, they chanted\n                their tribal songs and war cries. And the inhabitants of Altamira looked on in astonishment -\n                'Watch out, the Indians are coming.' It was like a scene out of a Wild West movie, except it\n                was real.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The meeting was opened by Paulinho Payakan in Altamira's crowded basketball hall. This\n                young Kayapo chief had had the idea of holding the gathering. He and his helpers had\n                organized it with extraordinary vigour and skill. He spoke into the microphone: 'Until\n                recently, we didn't have much reason to believe that the white man would ever understand\n                the Indians, our ways of thinking and living. But now we see groups of lndians and white\n                people working together to save the Amazon forest.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the hall, Kayapo and Xavante warriors displayed their colourful presence, in head-dresses\n                made from parrot feathers. They chanted in support of their chiefs, who gave sad and\n                rousing speeches about decades of death, defending the right of the Indians to live in their\n                own way in the forest, looking after it rather than destroying it. They booed the director of\n                Electronorte, the electricity company that wanted to flood the forests around Altamira with\n                a series of hydroelectric reservoirs the size of Belgium.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some speakers from the ecology movement pointed out that the Amazon forest contains\n                the greatest variety of plants, animals and insects anywhere on Earth. Many even today had\n                only Indian names.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Others, such as Brazilian ecologist Dr Jose Lutzenberger, were more concerned about the\n                effects of large-scale deforestation on the climate: 'We destroy the trees at our peril. Where\n                the forest disappears and scrub or naked soil takes its place, evapo-transpiration is replaced\n                by hot updraughts that dissolve incoming clouds. If the present rate of deforestation\n                continues in the east, in the states of Para and Maranhiio, it could soon trigger a collapse in\n                the whole system, perhaps before 30 or 40 per cent of the forest is cleared.'\n                The Indian camp was in the grounds of a mission station outside the town, right on the edge\n                of the forest. Young Kayapo warriors had built huts for their people from tree branches and\n                palm leaves. There were Indians sleeping in hammocks, cooking fish, manioc arid bananas,\n                mothers suckling their babies, their tiny faces painted red with the sap of urucum nuts. Men\n                were carving wooden clubs or making baskets, little boys were playing with their pet\n                monkeys, girls were threading brightly coloured beads into bracelets and necklaces, just as\n                they did in the village back home.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But here they were mobbed by photographers and cameramen, who lapped up the tribal\n                dancing and the bright colours of the jungle culture. They filmed these scenes as they\n                themselves were being filmed by Indians using video cameras.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But in the streets of Altamira people congregated for a great counter-demonstration in\n                support of the Kararao dam. The cattle ranchers had mustered the support of traders and\n                settlers and they all shouted 'we want the dam, we want the dam'. They had been led to\n                believe that dams mean progress and a better life. And Altamira certainly needs progress:\n                everywhere there are holes in the roads, living conditions are atrocious and there are hardly\n                any jobs to be had.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But, in the meeting, scientists stated that big dams mean trouble. The Balbina dam, near\n                Manaus, in particular, only recently completed, proved that point. There were millions of\n                dead trees left standing in the water. A huge area of good land had been flooded, and there\n                were now few fish. New diseases like leishmaniosis were spreading like wildfire. The\n                turbines were corroded by the stinking, acidic water and they produced only a quarter of\n                the electricity that had been anticipated.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians and the ecologists pointed out that progress does not have to mean giant dams\n                and enormous forest fires. Sensitive small-scale development was much more sensible than\n                megaprojects. Amazonia needed a new approach to development that did not devastate the\n                forests.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians told the Brazilian government that they would rather die than suffer further\n                land loss. One old Kayapo woman, Kokumi, took the microphone, an object she'd probably\n                never seen before in her life, and said this to a hushed audience: 'Listen, white man, you\n                have already got plenty of land, and we, the Indians, have only little left. These are our\n                lands, our waters, our forests. Our food depends on the game animals and the resources of\n                the forests and the rivers. I have already many grandchildren, and their health depends on\n                these things. Let us go on to live on our lands in peace.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Altamira gathering may well prove to have been a turning point in the story of the\n                Brazilian Amazon. The Indians had shown that they are a political force to be reckoned with\n                both within the country and well beyond the borders of Brazil. They can now, cautiously,\n                count on a network of supporters that stretches as far as the US Congress, the European\n                Parliament and the British House of Commons.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians are, at last, being recognized as guardians of the integrity of the rainforest. Their\n                ancient knowledge is increasingly acknowledged as a vital contribution to scientific\n                understanding. Many new important crops and products which could benefit humanity\n                could be developed from rainforest plants.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One participant at the Altamira gathering, Anita Roddick, the founder of the Body Shop\n                chain, was inspired to set up a new department to investigate plant oils and dyes used by\n                rainforest tribes like the Kayapo. The company decided to buy several tons of brazil-nut oil\n                from the Kayapo every year, to be incorporated into new cosmetics products. A few other\n                companies are now also purchasing plant products in tribal villages on a fair-trade basis\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But it is not only the Indians who are experts of the rainforest. Rubber tappers, too, use the\n                forest without destroying it. Their struggle to prevent its further annihilation was\n                highlighted as a result of the murder of rubber tappers' leader Chico Mendes in December\n                1988. For years, he and his fellow rubber tappers and brazil-nut collectors had been fighting\n                the cattle ranchers in order to prevent the conversion of forests into pasture. Mendes had\n                called for the creation of 'extractive reserves' which would enable people to live by\n                harvesting from the forest without killing it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At the Altamira gathering the forest peoples' alliance created by Indian leader Ailton Krenak\n                and Chico Mendes was represented, among others, by one of his successors, Gumercindo.\n                He, too, delivered an eloquent speech: 'The struggle of the rubber tappers and the people of\n                the forest is, above all, a struggle for life. We have to fight for an end to the violence to\n                ourselves and the forest. I think this is the movement's future: to spread across the whole of\n                the Amazon region, with schools in extractive reserves that will be set up throughout; with\n                health-care clinics and co-operatives to market the goods; with research centres where the\n                people of the forest may develop new technologies, so that they can utilize the forest better\n                without it being destroyed.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To the astonishment of the forest people, the outgoing government of President Sarney\n                decided in January 1990 to demarcate the first official extractive reserve in the state of\n                Acre. The Upper Jurua Valley Extractive Reserve covers 500,000, forming one of the world's\n                largest areas marked for environmental preservation. It contains great numbers of rubber\n                and brazil-nut trees. Until recently these were exploited by rubber tappers and Indians on\n                behalf of 'rubber barons' who held their workers under a system of debt bondage. Today a\n                co-operative runs the reserve and guarantees acceptable living conditions for the people\n                living in it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There has been a wind of change in the Amazon since the end of the 1980s. The forest\n                peoples' movement has made sure of that, in close co-operation with their allies in Europe\n                and the USA. Constant pressure from environment groups has led to major policy changes.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the summer of 1989, for the first time, the Brazilian government, having created a new\n                environment agency, IBAMA, took measures to reduce the scale of the Amazon fires. For\n                the first time in many years, new subsidies were no longer granted to cattle ranchers for\n                expanding their ranch land by burning the forest. The government rented six helicopters,\n                with which it had to monitor an area the size of Western Europe. Its forest patrols were co-\n                ordinated with the photographs transmitted every day by the Brazilian space agency's\n                satellite, which is able to pinpoint even the smallest fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Flying in one of the government helicopters over the state of Acre it was still appalling to\n                see the many forest fires, some of which were evidently illegal. But most were on a small\n                scale, a few dozen acres at a time rather than the gigantic fires covering thousands of acres\n                we had witnessed the year before. Some of the offending landowners were fined but,\n                because many of them are absentee landlords, with addresses in Rio or Sao Paulo, it was\n                often difficult to enforce these fines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                For the first time in years, there was an overall reduction in the annual forest destruction.\n                But nobody should be under the impression that the destruction has been halted. Logging in\n                the Amazon is on the increase as other tropical-forest countries run out of timber. A mature\n                tree can be worth up to a thousand dollars standing, and more than $ 10,000 in a stack of\n                planks in Belem harbour. And wherever a new logging road is cut, access for slash-bum\n                agriculturalists becomes easier, encouraging predatory settlement in the virgin forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At the beginning of 1990, the new president, Fernando Collor, appointed as his special\n                secretary for the environment Brazil's most radical environmentalist, Dr Jose Lutzenberger.\n                With the president's backing, he promised sweeping changes in the policy for the Amazon,\n                emphasizing just how important these forests are for the ecological future of Brazil and,\n                indeed, for the whole world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Collor administration surprised the world with an enlightened attitude to the Amazon\n                and its peoples, but it remains to be seen whether these will be lasting changes. Many\n                Brazilians resent foreign interference: the Amazon is there to be exploited and foreigners\n                who try to prevent this are meddling in Brazil's internal affairs.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Ultimately, it is only the peoples of the Amazon themselves who can prevent the massacre\n                of the forest by outsiders. Many different groups have shown extraordinary skill and\n                courage in recent years and they need all the support from us they can get!\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Brazil has about 60 per cent of the Amazon forest on its territory, but it extends into eight\n                other countries. Of these, Colombia has a particularly enlightened forest policy. In 1990, the\n                outgoing administration of President Virgilio Barco showed great imagination and far-\n                sightedness by giving title to no fewer than forty-five million acres of Amazon forest to the\n                country's Indians, nearly half the total area of forest in the country, four-fifths the size of\n                Britain. The new Colombian policies were initiated and are now administered by\n                anthropologist Martin von Hildebrand.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Colombia has taken the world lead in recognizing its obligations to its Amerindian peoples\n                and in taking steps to stop the devastation of its part of the Amazon forest, which contains\n                some 10 per cent of the world's plant and animal species. There are at least 50,000 species\n                of flowering plants, some 1,750 bird species and 4,000 different kinds of butterflies, and\n                many of these are extremely localized and still known only by Indian names.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The prospects for the Amazon forest look better than they have for a long time. After\n                decades of senseless devastation, we may be heading for a period in which the\n                environmental services of the Amazon forest and of its people are better appreciated.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Sadly, the same cannot, as yet, be said for the rainforests of Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma,\n                Madagascar, the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Zaire and the Congo. In all these countries, the\n                pressure of logging and mining companies and of settlers hungry for land in the rainforests\n                is still enormous. Invariably, indigenous groups are facing the threat of annihilation as the\n                forests are destroyed around them.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                According to Norman Myers, as quoted in ‘Global Warming’, ed. Jeremy Leggett, worldwide\n                destruction of rainforests has recently been occurring at at an annual rate of some 1.8 per\n                cent, 35.5 million acres a year or 67 .5 acres a minute. But in African countries like the Ivory\n                Coast and Nigeria annual loss is presently around 15 per cent, in the Philippines and\n                Madagascar over eight per cent. About 1.4 billion acres of pristine rainforests remain, less\n                than half the area forty years ago, and 52 per cent of these are in just three countries: Brazil,\n                Zaire and Indonesia.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Thailand's example is indicative of what could soon happen elsewhere in the tropics: in\n                thirty years, its forest cover went down from two-thirds to just over a quarter, mainly\n                because of export-oriented logging. With the population doubling, many deforested areas\n                were taken over by slash-burn agriculturalists hungry for land. But landslides in the hilly\n                uplands now frequently endanger the lives of settlers. At present, Thailand's annual forest\n                loss is low, because accessible forests have all but vanished. Today, it feeds its sawmills with\n                timber from Burma, contributing to that country's forest destruction.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the lowlands of Thailand, just 50,000 acres of forest are left at Khao Noi Chu chi. Despite\n                its tiny size, this remnant forest contains an astonishing wealth of plant and animal species,\n                including an extremely rare bird called Guerney's pitta, or jewel thrush, famed for its\n                fabulous blue and yellow plumage. Once abundant, it had been thought to be extinct, but\n                was rediscovered in this forest in 1986. Just fifteen to twenty pairs of the jewel thrush are\n                left. It is impossible to say how many other less spectacular plant and animal species will be\n                lost if this last area of lowland forest is destroyed.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Species other than humans have a right to exist. This seems an obvious point, but in recent\n                decades it could not be taken for granted. Only a little over 3 per cent of the surface of the\n                planet is actually legally protected, and even some of these areas continue to be\n                threatened.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Flying over the canopy of the still vast Amazon forest in spring of 1990, I was awed by the\n                sheer abundance and exuberance of this primeval world of trees and water. The rivers\n                wound their way through the green land below us, intertwined with each other and with the\n                forest like giant snakes. They were not confined for ever to permanent beds of their own. As\n                they flooded their banks and changed their courses, they had left behind bits of themselves\n                in the flat landscape, so-called oxbow lakes, stretches of water separated from the river of\n                which they were once part.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Here and there the occasional hill rose out of the plain, the sky above it like a mountain\n                landscape of enormous glacier-like clouds suspended in a stark blue sky. This part of the\n                Amazon forest was bathed in glittering light, the crowns of the trees stretched out towards\n                us, their myriad of leaves seeking the sun. But our helicopter was not the sun, only a noisy\n                mobile observation platform for curious visitors from another world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Our pilot had been flying over the Amazon for twenty years and he was proud to show us\n                his familiar world. From time to time, he dived down to just above the tree tops to get the\n                birds off their nests or perches so that we could see them better. Of course, with all that\n                engine noise you are unable to hear them screeching and calling out to each other. But we\n                could see them rising from the trees and sailing over the forest - parrots, toucans, eagles\n                and herons, some by themselves, some flying in groups.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The shapes of the trees were of an astonishing variety, the tallest ones laden with orchids\n                and creepers all seeking the power of the sun. Here and there, we saw trees covered in\n                mauve or yellow blossoms, but the helicopter moved on so relentlessly there was no time to\n                become familiar with any single tree or bird or flower. And even the curved horizon moved\n                on, like a mobile theatre set, changing minute by minute.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Amazon is an epic landscape. Forests, rivers and sky are interwoven like a majestic\n                tapestry. I knew that down there, below us, was the greatest assembly of life on Earth, ever\n                changing yet ever constant, never touched by an ice age or other such traumatic event.\n                Who would have thought that humans, even equipped with bulldozers and chain saws,\n                would be able to get the better of such a triumphant world of nature in large parts of the\n                tropics? But now, at last, we are becoming aware that our man-made world will be in peril if\n                these great forests vanish. Perhaps the process of halting the destruction has at last begun.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Earthrise","import React from 'react';\nimport

 flower meadows bearing cows and sheep\n                        and orchards and vineyards laden with fruit.\n                        Wheat fields waving yellow in the breeze,\n                        and ancient villages resting in patient landscapes,\n                        hedgerows and country lanes engraved\n                        on maps of parchment memory.\n

rocky summits,\n                        rainstorms emptying heavy crystal clouds,\n                        and streams cascading through mountain forests,\n                        with rivers

    and being readied for a faster future.\n                        Restless rivers caged by concrete banks,\n                        a village world that’s being swiped away\n                        by bulldozers gouging out copses,\n                        levelling secret hollows,\n                        ripping through forgotten garden soil,\n                        ancient landscapes

to office towers in electric cities,\n                        drawn by the promise of easy futures,\n                        by ever ascending colour charts\n                        on cinema sized

   in rooms pumped full of selfie songs,\n                        as fiddles, flutes and cowbells hang\n                        on dusty walls as silent decoration.\n

      with painted tattoos shouting\n                        “No more of this,\n                        let there be future,\n                        let there be life again,\n
