I casually said: ‘of course, we\n                    are what we eat, aren’t we’? She looked at me rather disparagingly and said: ‘No, no,\n                    wrong: We are what we assimilate’. She went on to talk about how the health of the\n                    internal flora of our digestion system determines how well we absorb the food we eat.\n                    Well absorbed nutrients help the body to form the cells which constitute the immune\n                    system and to assure a healthy organism. Poor digestive function means poor assimilation,\n                    chronically low energy levels, poor immune responses and an ever-diminishing level of\n                    stamina and vitality.\n                    </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>In the 21 st century humanity is eating more food from larger areas of farmland than ever\n                    before in our history, and this is determined by both our numbers, our meat-centric diet and\n                    our global food trading systems. Our collective food consumption patterns have become the\n                    main interface between ourselves and the world’s soils. If food is badly assimilated by us the\n                    impacts of a relentlessly urbanising humanity on our home planet are likely to become ever\n                    more severe.</p>\n                    <p>\n                    While we individually are affected by what we assimilate what we eat, the world’s soils and\n                    ecosystems are, above all else, affected by what we eliminate from our bodies, our\n                    households, or from entire cities. We use resources without much concern about their\n                    origin or the destination of our wastes: inputs and outputs are considered to be largely\n                    unconnected. Nutrients are removed from farmland and not returned to it. Forests are\n                    logged but often not replanted. Fossil fuels are prised out of rock strata, refined and burned,\n                    causing air pollution and climate change. Raw materials are extracted and made into\n                    consumer goods and end up polluting living nature.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Apart from the food we eat, we also need to reflect on how it is sold to us, invariably\n                    wrapped in plastic. The careless use and irresponsible disposal of plastics has recently been\n                    widely reported. Every day there is more news about plastic waste littering the world’s\n                    beaches and oceans, and more harrowing pictures of marine wildlife starved or entangled\n                    by plastic detritus. Back in the early 1960s one could find few bits of plastics on American\n                    and European beaches. But that was then. Today over 12 million tonnes of plastic bottles,\n                    bags, food wrappers, microbeads and fishing nets pollute the oceans each year, a truck load\n                    every minute. Much of what we eliminate cannot be assimilated by nature.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Many people have responded, no longer willing to turn a blind eye. All over the world you\n                    can now see beach cleaning parties. Inventors have come up with devices to collect up\n                    plastic debris with booms, or to gobble them up with suction devices. But as the consumer\n                    revolution hits Asia and Africa, the plastics tide is swelling to unprecedented proportions,\n                    drifting in ocean currents and even clogging beaches of uninhabited islands or accumulating\n                    in Arctic ice. All in all, the world’s response so far has been woefully inadequate to the scale\n                    and severity of the problem.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    This vividly illustrates probably a profound, systemic problem with modern civilisation: it is\n                    an essentially linear system. Much of what we eliminate cannot be assimilated by the\n                    world’s ecosystems. Yet we should ask Nature to be our teacher: the natural world is an\n                    essentially circular system and invariably turns its waste products into nutrients for new\n                    growth: every output by an organism renews the living environment. This is demonstrated\n                    most visibly and vividly as leaves fall onto the forest floor in the autumn and become leaf\n                    mould and soil by the complex interactions of many forms of ‘life in earth’.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    The organic movement, of course, has understood this. It has set itself the task of protecting\n                    and enhancing soil life, as well as human well-being. It is also increasingly concerned itself\n                    with trying to counter climate change via soil carbon storage and reforestation. This is very\n                    timely indeed, as droughts, storms and extreme floods have been increasing across the\n                    world in both frequency and severity.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    We urgently need to accelerate safe, healthy food systems that enhance ‘life in earth’ as\n                    well as life on earth. Agroecological practices, such as permaculture and agroforestry, are\n                    showing the way. And, of course, we must make sure to eat better quality food, to minimise\n                    food wastage and to move towards eliminating plastic food packaging.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Closing the circle</h4>\n                <p>\n                As we face ever greater impacts on the environment it seems important to go back to first\n                principles. In his book The Closing Circle, 1971, American ecologist Barry Commoner defined\n                four laws of ecology which have stood the test of time:\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Everything is connected to everything else. There is one ecosphere for all living\n                        organisms and what affects one affects all.</li>\n                        <br></br>\n                    <li>Everything must go somewhere. There is no ‘waste’ in nature and there is no ‘away’\n                        to which it can be thrown.</li>\n                        <br></br>\n                    <li>Nature knows best. The absence of a particular substance from nature is often a sign\n                        that it is incompatible with the chemistry of life.</li>\n                        <br></br>\n                    <li>Nothing comes from nothing. Exploitation of nature always carries ecological costs\n                        and these costs are significant.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <br></br>\n                In this context, the concept of sustainability may no longer suffice as a frame of reference\n                for our actions. It is no longer good enough to just try and sustain soils, forests and\n                watercourses in a profoundly degraded condition – we need to take active measures to\n                regenerate them instead. In this context, it is most important to address the relationship\n                between farming and cities as the world’s primary food consumers. Organic, regenerative\n                farming is, above all else, about closing the loop between food production, nutrient supply\n                and soil life.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Lack of concern about this is vividly demonstrated by the deplorable condition of many river\n                estuaries, and not just regarding the ubiquitous presence of plastics debris: all over the\n                world estuaries have become dead zones, due to excessive nitrogen and phosphorus\n                pollution. This is a systemic problem: Urban sewage is not recycled, and farmland is kept\n                productive artificially by the use of chemical fertilisers. Across the world there are now\n                some 500 dead zones where marine life has perished due to depleted oxygen levels:\n                nutrient run-off from chemical agriculture combines with urban sewage and causes the\n                growth of algae which sink to the bottom and use up oxygen when they decompose.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The world’s largest dead zone – in the Gulf of Mexico – covers 27,000 square miles in the\n                summer months. The reason? The Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of US: surplus\n                fertiliser from the farmland of 31 states, plus waste water from some 12 million city people.\n                1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen are discharged into the Gulf every year, causing\n                eutrophication and the death of oxygen producing marine ecosystems!\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Closer to home, much of the Baltic is another vast dead zone for the same reason. Whilst\n                the surrounding countries have agreed an Action Plan to reduce nutrients loads, so far there\n                has been little improvement in the condition of the Baltic.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In Britain we used to have a major problem with eutrophication in the Thames estuary, but\n                incineration of much of London’s domestic sewage has reduced this problem. But, of course,\n                this does not address the fact that the nutrients it contains are not returned to farmland as\n                fertiliser.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Closing the circle between urban food consumers and the farms that produce this food\n                through regenerative practices is an, as yet, unresolved issue. Contamination of sewage\n                with heavy metals, chemicals and medicines has caused the EU to prohibit the use of\n                sewage as fertiliser. It is argued that this pollution problem can only be solved if domestic\n                waste water is collected and treated separately from industrial waste, and only then used in\n                agriculture.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In some regions, such as South Australia, these issues have been vigorously addressed: the\n                region is heading for 100% reuse of waste water in urban fringe farming. Viticulture, market\n                gardens and agroforestry projects now utilise both recycled sewage and urban green waste\n                compost. Soils in the Adelaide Plain have been regenerated, and more carbon is\n                sequestered from the atmosphere at the same time.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                This example could be copied if Britain were to adopt its own waste water reuse standards\n                in a post-Brexit world. An additional dimension of this issue is that the world&#39;s phosphorus\n                deposits are being depleted at an alarming rate. At current consumption levels, we will run\n                out of known phosphorus reserves by around 2100, but meanwhile consumption can only\n                increase further under the pressure of ever increasing global food demands.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We can no longer afford to waste precious mineral resources in linear systems of resource\n                use. Regenerating the vitality of soils and ecosystems is crucial in an urbanising, climate-\n                challenged world heading for ever greater food challenges. We need to give nature a chance\n                to beneficially assimilate human wastes, and to help initiate innovative policy changes to\n                deal with these vital matters.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Regenerative development is about giving back as well as taking – maintaining a proactive\n                relationship between humanity and the world’s ecosystems, and nurturing nature’s\n                dynamism and abundance whilst drawing on its income. Again: we need to help regenerate\n\n                soils, forests and watercourses that our cities depend on, rather than just accepting that\n                they are ‘sustained’ in a degraded condition.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Dealing with the environmental implications of an urbanising world is a new challenge for\n                humanity and this requires the evolution of a new consciousness, linking the wellbeing of\n                individual citizens with humanity’s collective interest in the health of our home planet.\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Landtosea","import React from 'react';\nimport './Forest.scss';\n\nclass Forest extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"forest\">\n                <div className=\"forestBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>A Forest Way of Life</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image forest\"></div>\n                    <p>\n                    <h4>This text was written for the Forest of Dean Resilience Anthology 2020:</h4>\n                    <br></br>\n                    For over 40 years I have lived surrounded by trees, on a few acres on the edge of Tintern\n                    Forest.

Some\n                    people think of forests of foreboding places, or even as places of menace. Well, I have never\n                    felt that way, ever since I roamed woodlands as a child, as birds flitted across the green air,\n                    as deer slipped silently by in the distance, as hares nibbled clumps of grass in forest\n                    clearings. I have sought the safety of a forest world since I was little, and even then the\n                    great, lacy canopy of trees conveyed a feeling of awe in me, as it still does today.</p>\n                <h4>A World Changes</h4>\n                <p>\n                Those of us who live in and around the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest don’t have to be\n                told that these are areas of outstanding natural beauty. In a country that only has about 12\n                percent forest cover they are truly special places. Why can’t much more of the land be\n                covered in forest? Their benefits are obvious: they clean polluted air, absorb carbon dioxide,\n                store and filtrate rain water, prevent soil erosion and supply wood for many uses. They\n                teach us about life on earth. And they offer us wonderful spaces to roam.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Much of the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest look like areas that have been largely\n                unchanged since time immemorial. Not so. Over time, these landscapes have gone through\n                an astonishing variety of adaptations.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The region has been inhabited for millennia, evidenced by remains of megalithic\n                monuments, and ancient hill forts. The Romans arrived at around AD 50, attracted by a\n                plentiful supply of timber, charcoal, iron ore, ochre and lime. The Anglo-Saxons carried on\n                exploiting these precious resources. Then Normans and the thee Tudors used the forest as a\n                hunting ground, whilst also exploiting the forest's fine timber as a ship building material.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From the late 18th century onwards the forest became an industrial region, initially utilising\n                charcoal for smelting the abundant iron ore. Oaks, beech, ash and hazel were coppiced for\n                this purpose, which was a very resilient way of using forest resources as the trees always\n                regrew from the stumps.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Then, in the 19 th century, coal started to be used for smelting the local iron ore instead, and\n                deep coal mines and iron mines, as well as steel, tinplate works and foundries started to dot\n                the landscape. Wood distillation works produced a range of chemicals, and all these\n                enterprises were connected by a network of railways and tramroads. At the start of the 20 th\n                century, competition from more suitable locations elsewhere in the UK gradually reduced\n                industrial activity in the area. The locals were increasingly left to their own devices once\n                more.\n                </p>\n                <h4>The Locals</h4>\n                <p>\n                The people of the forest have always played their part in any new commercial activity. They\n                supplied the workforce for nobles and kings, and for forest, and mining and industrial\n                enterprises, with only limited benefit to themselves. In addition to any monetary gain they\n                subsisted on crops grown on smallholdings and cottages gardens.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The forest people are masters of a form of traditional permaculture: combining vegetable\n                gardening with growing soft fruit and orchards, and planting edible hedges. Chicken and a\n                pig or two to supplemented their family diet and produced manure. Some people still utilise\n                the ancient privilege of grazing sheep in the forest and on the road verges. These are truly\n                resilient ways of living.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Today, parts of the forest could be described as a model for ‘rewilding’, allowing landscapes\n                to revert to their natural existence with only limited human interference. The wild boar now\n                roaming the Forest of Dean again are a source of meat for some and a menace to other,\n                particularly when they invade household gardens.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Beauty and Ecology</h4>\n                <p>\n                In the local forests we can experience a living multi-story green landscape reminiscent of\n                Britain’s ancient past. This kind of landscape is reflected in the vivid imagery of Celtic\n                ornaments, in which trees and their branches and leaves are intertwined with all manner of\n                forest animals. Perhaps this is a good way to convey in artistic images what one scientist\n                recently called the ‘Wood Wide Web’.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The forests around us can literally speak for themselves. There are many layers of\n                communication within an intact forest ecosystem that has grown organically over time. It is\n                now well accepted that trees communicate via their root systems and also via the strands of\n                fungi through which they are interconnected within the soil. Natural forests are living\n                superorganisms that have a complex community life of their own.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We should never forget: forests covered much of the planet before humans invented\n                farming and herding some 12,000 years ago. We humans have tended to be a menace to\n                forests. With our chainsaws, bulldozers and tractors we are now better equipped at clearing\n                forests than ever before, converting trees into window frames, into furniture, into toilet\n                paper, into charcoal.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                If they could speak our language, forests would probably tell us that they would rather\n                prefer a world without people. Given half a chance, forests are self-perpetuating places.\n                They will always assure their continuity, as they drop their seeds in late summer, as they\n                shed their leaves in the autumn. The synergy of many living organisms that depend on each\n                other is astonishing to learn about, in the coexistence of a myriad of living beings.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                These days we read much about the plight of tropical rainforests. Here in the UK places such\n                as the Forest of Dean could be called rainforests, too. When we walk in the forest on a rainy\n                day, we may realise that the mist that permeates the forest is an essential part of the forest\n                ecosystem. The moisture that is given off by the trees also keeps the forest alive, and keeps\n                our human communities supplied with water.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                You may say that life is not all about coexistence and cooperation, but that competition is\n                the name of the overarching principle of life on earth– the survival of the fittest and all that.\n                Well when you walk in the forest you certainly see evidence of that, too. You see trees that\n                have died because they have not grown as fast their neighbours and been shaded out by the\n                bigger trees. But maintaining the continuity of life in its interdependent totality is\n                increasingly seen as the key underlying principle of resilient ecological systems.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Today and Tomorrow</h4>\n                <p>\n                Today, of course, the forest has become a favoured destination for visitors and holiday\n                makers with their SUVs and camper vans, coming over from cities such as Bristol and\n                Gloucester. Cyclists love criss-crossing the green landscape where every turn of the wheel\n                offers a different view.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                For city people, reconnecting with the natural environment and its amazing sights, sounds,\n                and textures can bring a deep sense of relaxation so absent from city life. The term forest\n                bathing – deep immersion in the life of the forest – has become part of the vocabulary of\n                visitors and holiday makers.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And for the forest people, life keeps changing again and again. City people have moved in,\n                buying run-down cottages as a refuge from stressful city life and to bring up families. Some\n                newcomers are welcomed by the locals, others are seen as arrogant intruders.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                What will the future look like? In the coming years more and more people will turn up\n                driving electric cars and bikes. Local resilience will be greatly augmented by the use of\n                renewable energy. Many cottages now feature solar panels, and more wind turbines will\n                make their appearance on the edge of the forest, contributing to the coffers of local\n                communities.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                What is the environmental future of our forests? One concern is the looming issue of\n                climate change. As the world gets warmer, will the vegetation that has grown here for time\n                immemorial still be suitable? Will oak, beech, ash and lime be able to cope with an ever-\n                warming climate?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One thing is clear. With so many changes having occurred over time, landscapes such as the\n                Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest have continued regardless. Ways of live come and go, but,\n                one way or another, continuity prevails. We owe it to future generations that they will have\n                a forest world to enjoy and benefit from as we have.\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Forest","import React from 'react';\nimport './CultureAndEcology.scss';\n\nclass CultureAndEcology extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"cultureAndEcology\">\n                <div className=\"cultureAndEcologyBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Culture and Ecology</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image cultureAndEcologyImage\"></div>\n                    <p>At a time when we are facing an unprecedented existential crisis in our relationship to nature, it\n                    would seem to be important to better understand the way traditional cultures have successfully\n                    meshed with their host environments across the world. They relate to their local ecosystems in\n                    many different ways, and it may be useful to take stock of some of these adaptations to help us\n                    make well-informed choices for the future\n                    <p>The natural environment is a key frame of reference for cultures the world over: Intimate interaction with it enable them to survive and to thrive. Invariably the food that they eat and the building materials and the firewood they use come from close by. And for times immemorial, people have developed ceremonies by which they celebrate the ‘land of their fathers and mothers’ in stories, songs and community events.</p></p>\n                </div>\n                <h4>Pygmy cultural ecology</h4>\n                <p>This is true, first and foremost, of our most ancient ‘contemporary ancestors’; the Pygmy communities who inhabit the rainforests of Central Africa. The little people have been at home in the shelter of trees, a world of flickering light and shade, for maybe 100,000 years. Their whole way of life is about being at peace with the forest, the throbbing heart of their familiar world. That is where they feel safe because they know it inside out. The forest supplies them with all their needs and they feed themselves without much effort as they follow their familiar, seasonal migration routes. Every tree, every animal, every stream and hill has a name. To live in a forest with all its ecological diversity means to know all its secrets.</p>\n                <p>What would seem to outsiders as a depressing world of gloom is a very different place to the Pygmies. It is a cool, restful, shady world illuminated by light filtering through the treetops, with occasional forest clearings and streams rich in fish. The forest is full of the sounds of innumerable creatures with whom they share their environment: forest elephants, monkeys, birds and frogs, all of whom speak their own languages. And fruit and nut trees are there in abundance, harvested by the little people whenever they are in season.</p>\n                <p>The Pygmies, of course, are hunter gatherers. Traditionally they never cut down trees to create gardens or farmland. In their ceremonies they sing the praises of the forest, the game animals, the berries and mushrooms, the sweet tasting roots and the honey bees. They also sing about the leopards that lurk among the trees. But both pygmies and leopards prefer to go their separate ways, respecting one another: The pygmies know about the leopard’s fearsome teeth and the leopards know about the pygmies bows and poison arrows.</p>\n                <p>Pygmies have been studied more intensely than most tribal cultures. They have fascinated anthropologists because their ancient lifestyle is so very different from the adaptations of farming and city people – from a world to which most of us belong today. Their profound reverence for their forest home is vividly described by Colin Turnbull in his book ‘The Forest People’. He lived in them in the Ituri Forest in the Congo for three years and was accepted as their friend. He describes their hunting parties, their nomadic camps, their illnesses, quarrels and their love affairs.</p>\n                <div className=\"image pygmyForestCamp\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">A pygmy forest camp, Congo</p>\n                <p>Turnbull is very eloquent in his descriptions: ‘What seems to other people to be eternal and depressing gloom, becomes a cool, restful, shady world. … If you have ears for it the forest is full of different sounds, exciting, mysterious, mournful, joyful. … There are a multitude of sounds … and the most joyful sound of all, to me, is the sound of the voices of the forest people as they sing a lusty chorus of praise to this wonderful world of theirs … it seems to come from all sides in sheer beauty and truth and goodness, full of the joy of living.’ </p>\n                <p>Turnbull describes the Molimo ceremony – a festival in which the Pygmies sing elaborate, multi-tonal songs to celebrate the goodness of the forest. One interviewee told him: ‘The forest is a father and mother to us. It gives us all we need – food, clothing, shelter, warmth and affection. … If something big goes wrong it must be because the forest is sleeping. We wake it up by singing to it … then everything will be well and good again … we sing to the forest because we want it to share our happiness.’ </p>\n                <p>All this stands in stark contrast to the attitudes of outsiders who are now clearing rainforests across the tropics for agricultural and urban development on an unprecedented scale.</p>\n                <h4>From Africa to Amazonia</h4>\n                <p>Central Africa’s Pygmy communities are not alone in their deep attachment to a forest world. Amazonia has many different forest cultures as well: tribes such as the Yanomami, Campa, Arara, Kayapo, Surui, Waorani and Assurini have all developed their own particular cultural adaptations to their local ecosystems. They, too, are long-standing forest dwellers, and they also gather food from the forest, and hunt and fish. But they are also forest farmers. They clear small patches of forest at a time to grow manioc roots and beans and bananas in the ash of their small-scale fires. As ‘slash-burn’ forest farmers, they remove only a little forest for their gardens each year, and after a few years they let the forest grow back, enriched with newly planted fruit and nut trees.</p>\n                <div className=\"image ceremony\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">A Kayapo ceremony, Brazil</p>\n                <p>Amerindians have been forest dwellers for some 20 to 25,000 years, long enough to develop a profound understanding of their forest world, the most diverse ecosystems anywhere on earth, with thousands of different trees, and tens of thousands of bird, mammal and insect species. </p>\n                <p>As forest cultures are studied by anthropologists and ethnobotanists, they are giving us a new understanding of the innate capabilities of the human mind. Once called primitives and uncivilised barbarians, they are finally being recognised as experts of some of the world's most complex ecosystems. They truly understand the ‘law of the jungle’, but it is not the cut-throat world that this term still implies: It is a world in which all living beings coexist in an immensely complex, interdependent web of life. And that includes the forest people themselves, the true guardians of this green world.</p>\n                <p>I have spent many months in the Amazon forest, in Brazil and Peru, making TV documentaries and have had the opportunity to study the environmental knowledge of Amerindians, and it is truly astounding. The documentary film Jungle Pharmacy, which I produced for Channel 4 in 1988, is concerned with the Indians’ knowledge of the forest and its medicinal plants. There is no doubt that the Indians are great experts in the medicinal uses of plants. Ethno-biologists from European and American universities, who studied with shamans of various Amazonian tribes, found that they had a word for every plant in the forest and a use for most. And why not? They have been living in Amazonia long enough to experiment with the uses of innumerable plants for nutrition and medicine.</p>\n                <p>Ethno-ecologist Darrell Posey pioneered an ecological understanding of Amazonian cultures, working for many years with the Kayapo in the Brazilian state of Para. In his book Kayapo ‘Ethnoecology and Culture’ he summarises his findings: ‘The Kayapo see the processes of the universe and life as cyclical. Plants, animals and people are all manifestations of the same dynamic energy. The Kayapo strive for a harmony with other elements of the universe, and sickness occurs when the balance of man and nature is upset. The overall balance between natural forces is maintained by performance of a complex cycle of rituals and ceremonies. These include singing and dancing and involve all Kayapo. Each individual is, therefore, directly involved in maintaining the harmony of life, and is an agent in the perpetuation of ecological stability and the well-being of self and society.’</p>\n                <p>One does not need scientific instruments to learn about the world – we can utilise our highly developed senses and the capacity of our brains, and the knowledge that is accumulated is passed on from generation to generation. Amerindians have given the world a large number of plant remedies as well as valuable food crops such as maize, potatoes, avocados, tomatoes, papaya, manioc, bananas, beans and chilly. Without these plants our modern diet would be so much poorer. They have a great deal to teach us to help us utilise the forests’ biological resources intelligently. Could some of their remedies fight the many diseases afflicting the world today?</p>\n                <p>The Amazonian tribes, like the pygmies, have a deep reverence for the forest they inhabit which they display in many intricate ceremonies. They tell us that they cannot survive without the forests which provide them with everything they need to live. These sentiments are eloquently  expressed by a leader of the Forest Peoples’ Alliance in Brazil, Elton Krenak:</p>\n                <p>‘The forest holds a far greater meaning for us than the city holds for the people who live there. An urban person from Sao Paolo who wishes to live in Tokyo or New York simply migrates there. The forest’s sons and daughters do not migrate, they change places in accordance with the forest natural cycles such as rainy and dry seasons, but they would never want to leave their forest. All the knowledge of our forest people is based on a permanent relationship with the places in which they live. The people who live in one valley see rivers and mountains in a very different way from a geologist or a biologist. A mountain for us has a name, has children, has loves, has a history, has a story to tell because it is witnessed life passing. Our songs, the ceremonial songs, the healing songs, the war songs, were all gifts from the forest. They were given to us by the animals, the water, the wind: the author and composer was nature.’</p>\n                <p>Similar statements come from a Waorani tribal leader, Nenquimote Nenquimo, a woman and mother. She says this:</p>\n                <p>‘It took us thousands of years to get to know the Amazon rainforest, to understand her ways,  her secrets, to learn to survive and thrive with her. … My elders are my teachers. The forest is my teacher. … What I can say … has to do with thousands of years of love for this forest. Love in the deepest sense, as reverence. This forest has taught me to walk lightly, and because we have listened, learned ad defender her, she has given us everything: water, clean air, nourishment, shelter, medicines, happiness, meaning. And you are taking all this away, not just from us, but from everyone on this planet, and from future generations.’ </p>\n                <p>These words could also have been those of forest people in Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, or Papua New Guinea. They all share an extraordinary knowledge and a great love for their forest world. Yet this is difficult to understand for people who are not familiar with their forest world. The Bantu people on the verges of rainforests in the Congo, for instance, have been encroaching on these ecosystems to establish pastures and farmland for centuries. They are scared of the forest and don't know how to make their living from it.</p>\n                <p>The same is true today of the cattle ranchers in Amazonia, who are now clearing forests there on an unprecedented scale, to supply expanding urban markets across the world. Over 20 per cent of the Amazon forests has been cleared in recent years to establish cattle ranches and soybean farms. The ranchers regard the forest as a green hell which they can't wait to get rid of to establish their facendas. Unfortunately, these ranches, established on fragile tropical forest soil, often stay fertile for only a few years, and where there was pristine rainforest there's only useless scrub now.</p>\n                <p>Rainforest ways-of-life are now under threat as never before from logging, mining and agricultural development. And as more roads are built and more forest is burned by large-scale fires, the tribal people are exposed to deadly new. The advance of modern civilisation has taken a terrible toll on the Amazonian tribes: numbering six or seven million before contact after 1492, today only some 250,000 remain.</p>\n                <h4>The food forests of the Chaga </h4>\n                <div className=\"image farmstead\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">A Chaga farmstead, Tanzania</p>\n                <p>Tropical agroforestry systems – combining tree crops, annual food crops and animal husbandry – are another interesting topic to study. Across the tropics, agroforestry has been practised for hundreds or even thousands of years. This type of cultivation system has multiple benefits compared to single-crop cultivation, such as stable yields and farmer livelihoods, increased biodiversity, improved soil structure, minimal erosion and enhanced carbon sequestration. </p>\n                <p>Some years ago, I visited and filmed the Chaga agroforestry communities on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania for the BBC. The Chaga originated from tribal groups such as the Masai in the plains of East Africa. Several hundred years ago they moved up into the lush forests on the southern slopes of Kilimanjaro where they developed a ‘multi-storey’ cultivation system, irrigated by mountain streams. They felled some of the trees, but maintained much of the forest cover, and under the newly open canopy they planted fruit and nut trees and banana and coffee bushes, with houses, huts and animal shelters scattered across the landscape. At ground level they cultivate vegetable crops such as millet, beans, taro and yam.</p>\n                <p>The land use system of the Chaga involves management of light, shade, soil, water, trees, bushes, vegetables and animals. Cows, goats, pigs and chickens supply fertiliser for the food crops. Water from the glacier is shared out between farmers in a complex irrigation system. The forest trees provide the Chaga with timber for building houses and animal sheds. Initially their tree crops were African varieties, but more recently fruit and nut trees that originate from Asia and South America, such as mango, breadfruit and palm trees, were also introduced.  </p>\n                <p>Today the Chaga grow most of Tanzania's export coffee in this complex multi-story cropping system. It contains nearly the same amount of biomass as the original tropical forests, but it also happens to support the highest human population density in East Africa: some 500 people per square kilometres. </p>\n                <p>The cultivation system of the Chaga is one of the many variants of agroforestry or permaculture, probably the most promising approach to long-term food security for people throughout the tropics. Today agroforestry systems are once again being adopted to assure food security in third world countries.  </p>\n                <h4>A Hearding Way of Life</h4>\n                <div className=\"image herder\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Nuer cattle herder, Sudan</p>\n                <p>I do not want to give the impression though, that it is only forest people or cultivators who have developed sustainable land use systems. One of the first major agro-ecological studies I the \n                1930s was about cattle herding people, the Nuer in the Sudan, some of whom still continue to practice their ancient way of life. This study, by the British anthropologist Edward Evans-Pritchard, showed how they, too, have long practised their own version of sustainable land use. They think that they live in the finest world’s finest land, even though outsiders would tend to see it as a monotonous savannah and marsh landscape. The land is certainly very suitable for cattle grazing, which the Nuer, and many other cattle herding people in Africa, have been conducting sustainably for thousands of years. These grasslands are much more suitable for grazing than for farming. People can't eat grass but cattle can and must. The milk the cows produce is the Nuer's primary source of food.</p>\n                <p>Evans-Pritchard calls the relationship between the Nuer and the cattle symbiotic: ‘Cattle and men sustain life by the reciprocal services to one another. In this intimate symbiotic relationship, men and beasts form a single community of the closest kind. The men wake about dawn in the midst of their cattle and sit contentedly watching them until milking is finished. They then either take them to pasture and spend the day watching them graze, driving them to water, composing songs about them, and bringing them back to camp. Or they remain in the kraal and drink the milk, make tethering cords and ornaments for them, water and in other ways care for their calves, clean the kraal, and dry the dung for fuel. When the cattle return in the evening, they tether each beast to its own peg with cords made from the skins of their dead companions. A man knows each animal of his herd and the herds of his neighbours and kinsman: its colour, the shape of its horns, its peculiarities, its history, its ancestry, and its progeny.’ </p>\n                <p>The life of cattle herders like the Nuer is seasonal. Herds are driven across their extensive territories according to the seasonal availability of grass. Cattle are the great love of people like the Nuer or their neighbours the Dinka – they sing songs to their favourite cattle and they name their children after them. Children learn from infancy how to look after the animals, how to milk them and how to protect them from raiders or wild animals. To live without cows means to them to live in abject poverty. To own cattle means to be wealthy, and rich Nuer are wealthy even in comparison with many cattle ranchers in today's Amazon. But unlike these, Nuer have developed a stable cattle culture in harmony with their local environment. The same is true of Sami reindeer herders in Norway and Finland, the Yak herders of Tibet and Nepal, or the Alpaca herders of the Andes. Their ways of life represent a well-thought-out, sustainable relationship with their mountain pastures. </p>\n                <h4>Alpine pastoralist cultures</h4>\n                <p>The same could be said for cattle-raising cultures like those still to be found across the Alps. In the mountain regions of Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria and France, cattle raising has been practised for centuries, and the local culture revolved around it. As a child I spent many summers months in the Allgaeu mountains in Bavaria, witnessing the lifestyle of mountain farmers.</p>\n                <p>In late spring, the cattle are herded from their winter homes in the valleys up to the herb-rich mountain pastures where they spend the summer months. The ringing sound of their bells is ever present. The cows’ milk is made into cheese. Each cow has its own name and is regarded as an individual in its own right. Lead cows have the largest bells and are given a degree of responsibility for the younger animals. The old cows know the mountain pastures best, and they know how to stop younger animals from grazing too close to dangerous rock cliffs.</p>\n                <div className=\"image cattle\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">The ‘Almabtrieb’ – decorated cows being herded down from the mountains, Austria</p>\n                <p>The mountain farmers know how to live sustainably. They maintain the fertility of the Alpine pastureland. They collect the manure accumulated in the lowland cowsheds during the winter months and return it to the grassland. They follow carefully established rules for keeping the steepest slopes covered in forest to prevent soil erosion. And the huge farmhouses in the valley, with cowsheds attached, are built of timber from those hillsides, whilst using the trees also a source of firewood.</p>\n                <p>In the autumn, when the grass stops growing on the mountain pastures, the cows are taken down back into the valley. Their horns are decorated with ornate garlands, and the premier cows who carry the largest bells take the lead in the great procession down from the mountain pastures. I have witnessed the arrival of such herds in their home villages. The cows know the farmhouses and stables to which they belong and they go straight back to them to spend the winter months. The arrival of the cows back in the villages is followed by exuberant celebrations with dancing, singing, eating and drinking in local bars and restaurants. With a sense of cultural purpose, the whole village comes together in an exuberant affirmation of a shared lifestyle. Today such celebrations have become well publicised spectacles all over the Alps, increasingly aimed at tourists and their money.</p>\n                <h4>Asian peasant farmers</h4>\n                <p>Traditional peasant farmers, too, have a well-established concept of trans-generational continuity, and their cultures reflect this. If they have a chance to evolve over long periods of time, they will tend to develop an ever-stronger sense of cultural purpose. In many parts of the world, small-scale farming is still the dominant way of life, if not disrupted by rapid population growth or loss of fertile land or land accumulation by outside interests. Farming, by definition, is an artificial activity – establishing the human presence on specific pieces of land to the detriment of other living species. But well-thought-out farming systems can do much to assure long-term environmental stability.</p>\n                <p>In his book ‘Farmers of 40 centuries’ Franklin Hiram King describes organic farming practices in China, Korea and Japan, and how they were based on a sustainable give-and-take between farming families and the land the utilised. Traditional practices included legume crops for nitrogen fixation, crop rotations and intercropping, terracing and the use of diverse crop varieties. Human, animal and crop wastes were systematically recycled to maintain soil fertility. </p>\n                <p>In his introduction to be book he says this: ‘Almost every foot of land is made to contribute material for food, fuel or fabric. Everything which can be made edible serves as food for man or domestic animals. Whatever cannot be eaten or worn is used for fuel. The wastes of the body, of fuel and of fabric worn beyond other use are taken back to the field; before doing so they are housed against waste from weather, compounded with intelligence and forethought and patiently labored with through one, three or even six months, to bring them into the most efficient form to serve as manure for the soil or as feed for the crop. It seems to be a golden rule … that whenever an extra hour or day of labor can promise even a little larger return then that shall be given, and neither a rainy day nor the hottest sunshine shall be permitted to cancel the obligation or defer its execution.’ </p>\n                <div className=\"image riceHarvest\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Rice harvest in China</p>\n                <p>As King points out, this meticulous system of farming, based on nutrient and carbon cycling has maintained soil fertility and structure over forty centuries are more, and would have continued to do so if it had been maintained in contemporary China.</p>\n                <h4>Human settlements and their hinterland</h4>\n                <p>Similar cultivation systems have been established all over the world, not least in Spain and Portugal. A British geographer, Philip White, studied long-established cultivation patterns he found in many parts of Spain. He found intricate arrangements for different crops around village locations arranged in concentric circles: ‘On a terrain which is almost homogeneous, the pattern of settlement and land use is remarkably geometric. In the middle of the plain there are enormous villages. Around the villages, the fields and gardens on the one hand, and the olives and vines on the other, are disposed in concentric circles. The latter crops generally are found nearer the village than three or four kilometres from the village. There is a third ring, the uncleared land abutting on the surrounding hill, devoted to grain and tree crops according to the needs of the population and the state of the market.’</p>\n                <p>Each of the crop circles surrounding the villages has different needs of cultivation and protection. Those closest to the village are most in need of regular manuring. They also tend to be the most valuable crops. Further away from the village, the vines, olives and fruit trees need attention only on a seasonal basis: in the spring and during harvest time in the summer and autumn. The grazing lands for sheep and goats are looked after by shepherds.</p>\n                <p>This kind of land use system corresponds closely with the arrangements observed In East Germany by geographer Heinrich von Thuenen and described in his book ‘The Isolated State’, published in 1826, just before the industrial revolution changed the world. He describes how  traditional towns and villages, in the absence of major transport systems, utilised the land in the surrounding countryside. He described these arrangements as a function of two primary factors: the cost of transporting crops to market, and the land rent farmers could afford to pay.</p>\n                <p>Von Thuenen’s model encompasses four concentric rings of land use surrounding a traditional European village or town. Horticulture and dairying lies in the first ring closest to the city since vegetables, fruit, milk and other dairy products must get to market quickly. The second ring is for timber and firewood, heavy materials that are difficult to transport over longer distances. The third ring consists of extensive fields crops, such as grain, that last longer than vegetables or dairy products. Ranching and rough grazing is located in the final, most distant ring. Beyond this fourth ring lies wilderness, which is too great a distance from the central town for any type of agricultural activity.</p>\n                <div className=\"image town\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">The town of Aachen in the 18th century surrounded by food crops </p>\n                <p>It is important, then, to realise that a sustainable relationship between settlements and local landscapes assured stable cultures which, in one way or another, existed for eons of time.</p>\n                <h4>Looking ahead</h4>\n                <p>In this essay I draw attention to traditional lifestyles and their cultural contexts because they would seem to be successful adaptations to local ecological realities. Over time, people have developed a tremendous variety of land use systems. These were reinforced by daily feedback with the local environment, enabling people to regularly assess the impacts they were having, and to take necessary measures to ensure continuity. All the varied cultures described here maintained a meticulous give-and-take between themselves and their local landscapes, reinforced by ceremonies, myths, stories and educational practices, helping children to partake in the established lifestyle.</p>\n                <p>What can we learn today from such practices? Faced with a global environmental crisis, it seems to me that it is important to try and understand the depth of the land use knowledge that people have accumulated over eons of time at the time.</p>\n                <p>A modern agribusiness farmer is a very different ‘creature’ compared with a hunter-gatherer or small-scale cultivator. For instance, a Chinese peasant, on a few acres of land, would grow small quantities of food, mainly rice and vegetables, for his family’s needs, plus a surplus for sale. On his farmstead, all human and animal waste would be recycled and, eventually, returned the soil. In this close-loop system, he would only use human and animal muscle power, maintained by the food crops grown on his land. This ‘circular metabolism’ enabled him to keep his land fertile generation after generation, assuring continuity of family and community life.</p>\n                <p>A modern wheat farmer in Kansas, or a soybean tycoon in Mato Grosso, by contrast, grows his crops on thousands or even tens of thousands of acres to supply distant markets. To keep his production system going, he uses a huge arsenal of farm machinery, pesticides and fertilisers. A large proportion of his crop has to be grown just to pay for all this technology. Soil productivity is not maintained by recycling organic waste but by applications of mineral fertilisers, a substantial proportion of which end up polluting groundwater, and nearby streams and rivers. Pesticides are used to counteract environmental imbalances inherent in monoculture. They, too, end up as pollutants of soil and water. Farm machinery, fertilisers and pesticides all originate from factories in some distant city, requiring large amounts of raw materials and energy in their manufacture.</p>\n                <p>It is obvious that the environmental impact of our agribusiness farmer is vastly greater than that of our Chinese peasant. To make this kind of extractive system, which has little concern for   long-term soil fertility, a model for farmers in developing countries would be to prejudice any chance of global sustainability. And yet, this is the preferred model of economic planners the world over, replacing the concept of continuity with that of never-ending progress. But now the instabilities we are causing as a result of soil and resource depletion, pollution and environmental damage are staring us in the face.</p>\n                <p>Whilst a whopping 70 per cent of the world’s farmland is still managed by small-scale family farms, rural peoples' access to land is under attack across the world. From Honduras to Kenya, from Palestine to the Philippines, from Brazil to Malaysia, people are being brutally dislodged from their forests, orchards, farms and villages. There have been agrarian strikes and protests in many places – by community leaders in Madagascar and Brazil, by landless folk in India and  Andalusia – the list of actions goes on and on. But despite this, land ownership is becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. </p>\n                <p></p>\n                <div className=\"image soybeans\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Soybean agribusiness in Mato Grosso, Brazil </p>\n                <p>To supply ever-expanding global urban markets, sustainable land use systems are rapidly being superseded by agribusiness. But in the face of the global environmental calamity upon us, we should assure that traditional land use systems are not forgotten. Can we find ways to translate such cultural adaptations to natural environments into plausible contemporary modes? There are some promising trends: A vigorous organic movement in Europe and America, and the application of ‘permaculture’ ideas in experimental projects across the world, would seem to be particularly important at this point in time. </p>\n                <p>A key point to make about the various ecological cultures I have described is that they draw their sustenance and energy supply from the living planet rather than from subterranean resources. Unprecedented access to fossil fuels has profoundly changed our relationship to the world around us. With oil available to us as never before, food today tends to come to our tables from distant places. For instance, in Germany or Britain today most of the fruit and vegetables we eat comes from Spain or Italy rather than from local fields. Animal feeds and bread wheat originate from faraway places such as Iowa, Canada or Brazil. Much of the timber we use is sourced by cutting down the forests that Pygmies or Amerindians call home.</p>\n                <p>In our daily lives all of us are contributing to environmental destruction on a global scale. To counter this, we need to find ways to better utilise global communications and turn them into a global nervous system capable of swiftly informing us of any damage being done to the earth, and to enable us to respond to this with appropriate collective measures. Underpinning this is the need for a clear scientific understanding of what we can and what we can’t do to the earth if we wish life to preserve life in all its varied forms.</p>\n                <p>To develop contemporary concepts of sustainable living requires us to think beyond economics, and to activate deeper layers of human consciousness represented by the broader concept of culture. We owe it to life on earth and to future generations to act vigorously in worldwide pollution prevention, conservation work and environmental regeneration. Learning from traditional practices can help us develop a new sense of continuity.

Can we detach\n                    ourselves from a seemingly irreversible entropic, degenerative, linear, downward\n                    spiral? How can a regenerative approach prevail?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    The crucial issue of environmental externalities has been discussed for decades, but\n                    with only gradual progress being made to deal with it. It is becoming apparent that if\n                    externalities are directly experienced at the local level, there is a good chance that\n                    they will eventually be addressed, particularly where people’s health is at stake.\n                    Relevant examples are effective measures that have been taken to deal with effects\n                    of smoking, asbestos pollution and contaminated drinking water.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    At the wider, national level economists have attempted to quantify the ecological\n                    costs of economic activity since the 1980s. In a pioneering study in 1986, economist\n                    Lutz Wicke costed the environmental damage caused by the West German economy\n                    at 6% of the country’s gross national product. To deal with this damage he\n                    recommended a comprehensive ecological tax reform to help stimulate the\n                    emergence of a regenerative economy. But most of these recommendations remain\n                    on the shelf while many systemic environmental problems remain stubbornly\n                    unsolved.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Climate change, of course is a global systemic externality of an urban-industrial\n                    civilisation relying on vast annual inputs of fossil fuel energy. Yet the world\n                    community still refrains from adopting correct price signals by methods such as cap-\n                    and-trade permits or by direct regulation, sufficient to internalize negative\n                    externalities. But, alas, the very rapid decrease in the costs of regenerative energy\n                    systems such a solar, wind and energy storage technologies is coming to the rescue.\n                    Initially stimulated by feed-in tariffs in Europe and Australia, regenerative energy\n                    technologies are increasingly self-funding as they become cost-competitive with\n                    fossil fuel-based energy technologies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    But even 100% adoption of renewable energy technologies will barely stabilise\n                    global carbon concentrations. Meanwhile the challenge is to stimulate the\n                    greenhouse gas absorption capacity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. But whilst\n                    we discharge ever more C02 into the atmosphere, the capacity of the biosphere to\n                    absorb it is being significantly reduced at the same time. From 1990 to 2015, natural\n                    forests declined from 4.28 billion to 3.99 billion ha, a loss of 290 million ha. Planted\n                    forests increased by 167 to 277 million ha. This may help to meet global timber\n                    demand, which is expected to triple by 2050, but it is not nearly enough to stabilise\n                    terrestrial carbon emissions. Large scale regeneration of both forest ecosystems and\n                    farmland soils is urgently needed to make a significant impact.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Another key, underreported systemic crisis we face is river water contamination\n                    caused by the twin problems of cities not returning the nutrients contained in urban\n                    sewage back to farmland. Meanwhile farmers are forced to replace these lost crop\n                    nutrients by applying artificial fertiliser to their fields instead, with substantial\n                    quantities leaching away into rivers. As a result, there are now some 500 dead zones\n                    in the world&#39;s oceans. Add the fact that we are likely to face phosphate fertiliser\n                    supply shortages in the coming decades, and it is clear how important it would be to\n                    close this particular circle through the introduction of regenerative sewage\n                    technologies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Now another global crisis is receiving much publicity: pollution of the oceans with\n                    plastic detritus is becoming a problem on a similar scale to climate change, but so far\n                    there is little action on the horizon to deal with it. It is becoming evident that this\n                    problem can only be solved by intercepting plastic waste before it enters the marine\n                    environment: Applying innovative recycling technologies that turn plastics – a long-\n                    lived material that is briefly used in short-term packaging – into long-lived products,\n                    such as building materials, bollards, decking, fence posts and garden furniture. But,\n                    again, the right price signals are required to make this possible.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    These three systemic crises can only be addressed by implementing various aspects\n                    of regenerative development. Moving from linear to circular systems, as advocated\n                    by the Ellen McArthur Foundation, has both biological and technical components:\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <h3>Circularity of living systems</h3>\n                    Perhaps the greatest challenge facing us is to turn modern economies and urban\n                    systems from linear into circular modes. Nature operates as an essentially circular\n                    system and invariably all its waste products become sources of new growth: every\n                    output by an organism is also an input which renews the living environment. Can we\n                    organise our economies to fit this model?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Pavan Sukhdev, president of WWF, argues that we need to overcome the problem\n                    of the economic invisibility of Nature. To align economic and ecological systems it is\n                    crucially important to understand that the value of ecosystems services is vast, and\n                    probably more than double the value of the global economy, as estimated by\n                    ecological economist Robert Constanza.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>   \n                    The concept of regenerative development, first and foremost, has to be anchored in\n                    a clear understanding of the integral and interdependent nature of living systems,\n                    with the sun powering all life processes on Earth. Creating regenerative economies\n                    means, above all else, to do everything possible to stimulate the regenerative\n                    capacity of nature by deliberate policies and incentives.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Crucially, we need to develop a comprehensive new understanding of the non-\n                    entropy of living systems: According to quantum physicist Erwin Schroedinger: “Life\n                    seems to be orderly and lawful behaviour of matter, not based exclusively on its\n                    tendency to go over from order to disorder, but based partly on existing order that is\n                    kept up … We must be prepared to find a new type of physical law prevailing in it. …\n                    From all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to\n                    find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics.”\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Similarly, according to the inventor of the concept of general systems theory, Ludwig\n                    von Bertalanffy, “the conventional formulations of physics are, in principle,\n                    inapplicable to the living organism being open systems having a steady state. We\n                    may well suspect that many characteristics of living systems which are paradoxical in\n                    view of the laws of physics are a consequence of this fact.”\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Under the right conditions, biological resources will always tend to renew\n                    themselves, and the inherent regenerative capacity of natural capital, such as\n                    forests, soils and aquatic ecosystems, is evident for all to see. The case for creating\n                    regenerative systems of resource use on land and in aquatic environments, as\n                    essential components of modern economies, is evident. We must surely try and do\n                    everything we can to assure that soils, forests and watercourses are enabled to\n                    continuously regenerate themselves. And specifically, in the case of farming, organic\n                    farming, or regenerative farming, should become the norm rather than the exception,\n                    driven by appropriate policies.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <h3>Circular technical systems?</h3>\n                    Modern economies need to be organised to mimic natural systems. But what does\n                    this mean for the technical systems on which so much of the wealth and comfort of\n                    modern civilisation are based? There is a marked difference between the circularity\n                    of biological systems as compared with the challenges facing technical systems. Our\n                    industrial economies are subject to the second law of thermodynamics: the use of\n                    fossil energy, their key ingredient, is an irreversible process. As we power technical\n                    processes, usable energy is irretrievably lost as unusable, dispersed waste. As\n                    energy is made to do ‘useful work’ for us, it inevitably ends up as pollution or\n                    disorder.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Modern urbanisation, intimately connected to economic development, is a major\n                    contributor to this process. Cities are giant heat engines: the energy they require for\n                    their many vital functions can be used only once, as fuels are converted into low\n                    grade heat and waste gases. And as raw materials are processed, their quality also\n                    inevitably deteriorates. Order, established in the form of urban settlements, causes\n                    disorder elsewhere in Nature as products are imported, utilised and discarded.\n                    Concentrating or ordering human activities in high-energy modern cities will tend to\n                    contribute to disorder, waste and pollution. The vast, global ecological footprints of\n                    cities are a case in point.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Between them, modern cities, and the economies they harbour, are ‘entropy\n                    accelerators’ – they downgrade the resources they require in the process of using\n                    them. A key challenge, then, is to find ways to replace high-entropy systems with\n                    low-entropy systems instead. This makes it all the more important to make\n                    renewable energy systems our main sources of energy in the very near future.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Technical systems do not have the inherent capacity to renew themselves in the\n                    same way as biological systems. This is where human inventiveness comes into\n                    play: The waste management mantra of refusing, reducing and recycling, of course,\n                    has been on the green agenda for decades. But there are systemic problems with\n                    this: much recycling is actually downcycling. A loss of quality is inevitable and major\n                    energy inputs are required to power it. Nevertheless, recycling and remanufacturing\n                    of technical products is an important part of a regenerative, green economy.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Again, this is vividly illustrated by the case of waste plastics. In industrialised\n                    countries, urgent action on redesigning packaging, reducing, recovering and\n                    stabilising the markets for recycled plastics through mandatory recycled content is\n                    paramount. All countries need to curb the use of single-use plastics, and to prevent\n                    stray plastics from ending up in waterways and the oceans beyond. The critical issue\n                    is to divert a long-lived material into long-term uses. After a brief use in packaging,\n                    plastics can be ‘put to rest’ in products that they are most suited to: as construction\n                    materials or even in road surfaces. The benefits are all too evident: Cleaner\n                    environments and the creation of a regenerative, green economy. China, as a\n                    booming industrial economy with vast pollution problems, is now beginning to make\n                    significant headway in this direction. Will other countries follow?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <h3>Regeneration for sustainability</h3>\n                    “Nature does not set out to be sustainable but achieves it because it is regenerative.\n                    If the economic system is to prosper long term, it must operate like nature;\n                    regeneratively,” said the authors of A finer future is possible, a report to the Club of\n                    Rome, published in 2016.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    In my own work, urban systems – as the primary location of economic activities –\n                    have been the central theme. As thinker in residence in Adelaide in 2003 I argued\n                    that a vigorous move towards regenerative development could greatly stimulate\n                    South Australia’s economy. The economic reasons for this are evident: a city region\n                    that takes active measures to improve the efficiency of its use of resource also\n                    reduces its reliance on imported resources – it re-localises parts of its energy and\n                    food economy and brings a substantial part of it back home. These concepts\n                    became the basis for a wide range of new policy initiatives by the government of\n                    South Australia. Today South Australia, a region of 1.8 million people, is a world\n                    leader in solar and wind energy, battery storage of electricity, solar-electric transport,\n                    organic waste recycling and composting, waste-water irrigation, urban-fringe organic\n                    farming and reforestation, etc.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    In my view the wording ‘Regenerative economies for a sustainable world’ is a simple\n                    and effective formula. Regenerative economies are the process and a sustainable\n                    world would be the outcome to strive for. This wording includes the confident use of\n                    the term sustainability, despite some of the baggage now associated with it. Without\n                    constant renewal and regeneration there can be no sustainability.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Regenerative","import React from 'react';\nimport './Sustainability.scss';\n\nclass Sustainability extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"sustainability\">\n                <div className=\"sustainabilityBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Sustainability is unhelpful: we need to think about regeneration</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image sustainabilityImage\"></div>\n                    <p>For 25 years, sustainable development has been held up as the solution to the world's\n                    problems.

The\n                    official definition is well known: \"Sustainable development … meets the needs of the\n                    present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"\n                    Effectively, it was a marriage of convenience to facilitate north-south collaboration on\n                    enhancing human livelihoods while also halting humanity's deteriorating relationship with\n                    its host planet.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>SD is a concept to which few people would object; most of us would agree that we should\n                    not live as if there were no tomorrow.

And yet, the very use of fossil fuels is\n                    inherently unsustainable as they are a finite resource, and their combustion is the\n                    predominant contributor to climate change.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    In any case, how long is sustainable: 10 years, 100 years, 1,000 years? And who and what\n                    should be sustainable: households, cities, whole nations, the world economy? And who\n                    should benefit: current generations or all humans who will ever be alive? And where is the\n                    critique of the current economic system: can SD really occur under the rules of capitalism,\n                    where the refusal to put a price on nature's services and on ecological and social\n                    externalities is a systemic problem?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    In my view, we need to start thinking of regenerative rather than just sustainable\n                    development. We urgently need to take specific measures to help regenerate soils, forests\n                    and watercourses rather than just allowing them to be sustained in an increasingly\n                    degraded condition as we have done for many years. We have the knowledge and the\n                    technologies to make renewable energy our main energy sources. And we urgently need to\n                    regenerate local communities and economies that have fallen by the wayside as economic\n                    globalisation has become a dominant force.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    It follows that only a systemic, rather than a vague compromise approach to future\n                    development will suffice, starting with the realisation that development cannot be at the\n                    expense of the health of the world's ecosystems and that their protection and continuous\n                    regeneration must be a guiding principle for human action. It is high time that these\n                    realisations were embedded in the teaching of economic theory at universities and business\n                    schools all over the world.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    An acute state of emergency exists on Earth, imperiling its climate, its life support systems\n                    and the lives of billions of people. Could we create a better conceptual framework to assure\n                    a plausible future for people and planet?\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    The concept of regenerative development aims to fill this gap: it means that we need to\n                    develop comprehensive rules for an environmentally enhancing, restorative relationship\n                    between humanity and the ecosystems from which we draw resources for our sustenance.\n                    In my own work, I have concentrated primarily on the metabolism of cities, examining urban\n                    resource consumption and waste disposal patterns. In an urbanising world, the bulk of\n                    human impacts on the biosphere are from urban production and consumption. Cities are\n                    the primary location of national economic activities. Modern cities are also defined by their\n                    dependence on the use of energy, with the bulk of the world's fossil being burned to power\n                    urban systems. Urban energy consumption and global climate change are intimately\n                    connected.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Much damage has been done to the world's ecosystems already, and urgent solutions need\n                    to be found to reverse it. The time has come for cities to take specific measures to help\n                    regenerate soils, forests and watercourses rather than just sustaining them in a degraded\n                    condition, and to make renewable energy their main sources of energy supply.\n                    Creating a circular rather than a linear urban metabolism – giving plant nutrients back to\n                    nature, storing carbon in soils and forests, reviving urban agriculture, powering human\n                    settlements efficiently by renewable energy, reconnecting cities to the regional hinterland –\n                    these measures are the basis for creating viable new urban economies which are so badly\n                    needed in this time of financial and economic crisis.\n                    Regenerative development is as much about an honest give-and-take between humans and\n                    nature as about reviving human communities at the local level. It is a concept that matches\n                    closely with the ideas of EF Schumacher, author of Small is Beautiful, in whose name the\n                    upcoming Schumacher Lectures are being held.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Sustainability","import React from 'react';\nimport './Metabolism.scss';\n\nclass Metabolism extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"metabolism\">\n                <div className=\"metabolismBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>The Metabolism of Cities</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image metabolismImage\"></div>\n                    <p> Ancient Rome, at the height of its power, obtained much of the grain needed to feed its citizens\n                        from North Africa. As its own farmland grew tired, and as ever more farmers were turned into\n                        soldiers, the insatiable appetite of the metropolis could be met only with foodstuffs grown further\n                        and further afield. North Africa became Rome’s primary supplier of grain, olives and wine.\n                        Freight ships criss-crossed the Mediterranean laden with produce from its colonies.\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                        The role of North Africa as Rome's breadbasket had profound implications in ecological terms:\n                        1) as the region’s forests were turned to farmland, there was a massive loss of tree cover with\n                        erosion and other consequences which are still felt today. 2) the export of grain to Rome was\n                        also an export of plant nutrients, or soil fertility, never to be returned. The soil fertility of much of\n                        North Africa was shoved through the stomachs of the Romans into the Mediterranean Sea.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                Rome, before its eventual decline, reached a population of about one million people. At the time\n                it was by far the largest – and most powerful – city in the world. It set patterns of urbanisation\n                still resonating today. Now, 2000 years later, nearly half the world's five billion people live in\n                cities. Never before has urban growth been as rapid as it is now. Everywhere small farmers are\n                leaving – or forced to leave – the land in search of urban livelihoods. Usually relatively self-\n                reliant peasants or herdsman, with traditions of caring for the land that they have inhabited for\n                millennia, are being turned into consumers of cash crops as they adopt an urban lifestyle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We all need food every day, but every meal we eat represents an export of plant nutrients from\n                the land where it came from, never to be returned. And where does the waste go? Well into the\n                sea eventually. This one-way transport of soil fertility, first practised on a large scale by Rome,\n                has now reached global proportions. There are hundreds of dead zones in the estuaries of\n                rivers across the world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 19th century, when London grew by leaps and bounds, the sewage accumulating in the\n                Thames became a huge challenge. The problem was ‘solved’ by building an extensive drainage\n                system – out of sight, out of mind. The sewage was, largely, dumped in the Channel, and not\n                put back on the land. In order to keep the farmland feeding London fertile, guano – bird\n                droppings – were used instead. They were shipped to the UK all the way from Chile.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                When the guano threatened to run out, scientists started to develop artificial fertilisers. Never\n                mind recycling sewage, they reasoned, we can supply mineral fertilisers – nitrate, phosphate,\n                potash – in bags. Subsequently sewage systems in cities all over the world have been designed\n                and constructed as disposal rather than recycling systems. Disposal, not recovery, became the\n                brief of sewage engineers. Thus much of the fertility of the world's farmland that feeds the\n                teeming billions in cities ends up in the rivers and in the sea.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And because sewage is considered a nuisance, not an asset, it may as well be mixed with\n                whatever else needs to be flushed out – cleaning fluids, disinfectants, chlorinated hydrocarbons,\n                heavy metals, and all the other poisons we discharge routinely from our households and\n                factories. The Romans didn't do that, but we do. And add a few million gallons of oil every year\n                and you end up with the kind of potent brew that fish have to cope with in coastal waters all over\n                the world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And then, add fertilisers – nitrates, phosphates and potash – from farmland, of which about half\n                is not absorbed by the food plants but leached into groundwater, and then washed out by\n                streams and rivers into the sea. And then add slurry from factory farms, much of it originally\n                imported as animal feed from distant land – another one-way transport of plant nutrients from\n                farmland to the sea.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Liquid and Solid Wastes</h4>\n                <p>\n                Ever since the 1960s there has been growing concern about the eutrophication of lakes in\n                heavily urbanised regions of Europe and the US: that is loss of oxygen in surface waters as a\n                result of overfeeding them with plant nutrients. The dire condition of Lake Erie, in particular,\n                made headlines. Since then the problem has not gone away, though the condition of some\n                lakes has been improved by the installation of more sophisticated sewage works and\n                oxygenation systems.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 1980s there is growing concern about the condition of coastal waters. Landlocked seas,\n                in particular, such as the Baltic and the Adriatic, are a real worry. Next on the list is the North\n                Sea where eutrophication now occurs every summer in places such as the German Byte. A\n                proliferation of algae is caused oversupply of plant nutrients from sewage, fertilisers and slurry\n                run-off. The algae act like a sort of poison bait to the fish because of the ever more varied\n                cocktail of toxins with which they are laced. They are heavily implicated in the rapid increase in\n                fish diseases that have been observed in coastal waters in recent years.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Modern cities have a much more complex metabolism than their ancient predecessors such as\n                Babylon, Carthage, Athens or indeed, Rome. Their environmental impact was largely confined\n                to forests (extraction of timber and firewood), soil (export of nutrients, erosion and salinisation)\n                and water (long range aqueducts). But archaeologists won't find any plastics, toxic wastes or\n                radioactive substances in any ancient rubbish dumps they examine.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In contrast, every inhabitant of the modern Western city, with urbanisation rates of up to 80\n                percent, generates around two tonnes of rubbish per year: one tonne of domestic refuse and\n                one tonne of factory waste from the industrial products we purchase. Future archaeologists,\n                investigating the waste dumps of modern cities, will be astonished at the sheer volume and\n                variety of artefacts, as well as the bizarre mixture of materials that we saw fit to use and to\n                dispose of.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Urban and industrial rubbish dumps, piled up over recent decades, pose an environmental\n                problem whose scale is, as yet, inadequately understood. It is becoming quite apparent now\n                that even ‘ordinary’ domestic rubbish is far from harmless. The impacts range from seepage of\n                potentially toxic liquids such as disinfectants, wood preservatives, cleaning fluids, used motor oil\n                and left-over medicines, to corrosion of discarded batteries, and to plastics residue. And waste\n                dumps invariably give off toxic fumes as they catch fire, which they often do.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Factory wastes, an essential ingredient of our consumer lifestyle, are often deposited in the\n                same dumps as household rubbish and greatly add to their pollution potential. In one part of the\n                United States, in New Jersey, where the content of waste dumps is being investigated closely,\n                hundreds of mixed waste dumps have been found to leach all manner of potent poisons into the\n                groundwater. In Germany and Britain similar problems have been unearthed.\n                </p>\n                <h4>The Age of Fire</h4>\n                <p>\n                Air pollution, too, is predominantly a problem of modern urban/industrial society. Coalmining,\n                when it got into full swing in the 19th century, made available unprecedented quantities of\n                carbon compounds for the purposes of combustion. As fire was tamed into motion power, it\n                came to replace muscle power in most heavy duty-applications, such as traction, transport,\n                manufacturing and farming.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Perhaps the most significant environmental impact of our urban/industrial civilisation is the\n                large-scale transfer of carbon from geological deposits into the atmosphere, in the form of\n                carbon dioxide. By the late 1980s, the CO2 content of the year had increased from the previous\n                265 to 345 ppm, or by 30 percent, going up by 1.5 ppm every year. This doesn't sound that\n                much but few atmospheric scientists now doubt the reality of the greenhouse effect and its\n                likely, dramatic global environmental impacts in the 21st\n                century.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But right now it is the other by-products of combustion which are the most immediate cause for\n                concern: notably sulphur and nitrogen oxides.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the 1980s it became increasingly clear that air pollution was by no means a problem of the\n                past as had been assumed after the worst urban smogs had been tackled by clean air\n                legislation that had been passed Britain and elsewhere. Fires in individual households had been\n                replaced by remote power stations with tall stacks fitted with dust filters, and this was thought to\n                be the solution to the air pollution problems of the industrialised countries. But not so: By the\n                early 1980s the horror stories of dying trees were beginning to hit deadlines, from Germany, to\n                Poland to Czechoslovakia. Most European countries reported serious damage to forests, with\n                the statistics showing a further decline every year.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Sulphur dioxide from power station and factory chimneys, as well as nitrogen oxides from these\n                chimneys and from car exhaust pipes, were implicated as the main culprits. In addition, some\n                3000 new man-made gases in trace quantities were identified as part of the cocktail of\n                pollutants in the air we all breathe. All living beings in the northern hemisphere are now exposed\n                to these waste gases to varying degrees.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Throughout the industrialised countries millions were spent researching the chemistry of trace\n                gases, their reactions with each other, their persistence in the atmosphere, and their impact on\n                the sensitive tissue of living matter. A further environmental problem was the erosion of the\n                ozone layer right at the top of the atmosphere by gases such as CFCs used in various industrial\n                applications. All of these are ingredients of the urban, convenience-oriented lifestyle which we\n                have come to take for granted.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Closing the Circle</h4>\n                <p>\n                The metabolism of modern cities as manifested at present – its throughput of foodstuffs, forest\n                products, fossil fuels and mineral resources – is demonstrably disruptive of the planet's life\n                support systems. Nevertheless, global urban-industrial development is accelerating as never\n                before. Less environmentally destructive traditional lifestyles, based on long established\n                sustainable practices of farming and renewable energy use, are everywhere under attack.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But fortunately, growing minorities of urban people are becoming increasingly aware of the\n                boomerang effect of our modern lifestyles. It is becoming apparent that we are on a collision\n                course with all the life support systems of our home planet. It is becoming clear that all our\n                futures are at stake, and self-interest is kicking in as a powerful motivating force for change.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The process of urbanisation and industrial development is likely o continue across the world, but\n                how can its destructiveness be curtailed?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The most profound problem we are up against lies in the linearity of the development processes\n                we are engaged in. Nutrients are taken from the land as food is grown, never to be returned.\n                Trees are felled for building materials or pulp, and all too often forests are not replenished. Raw\n                materials are extracted and processed into consumer goods which end up as rubbish which\n                can’t be beneficially reabsorbed into living nature. Fossil fuels are extracted from rock strata,\n                refined and burnt and thus released into the atmosphere. All in all, our present civilisation is\n                vastly accelerating the process of entropy with, as yet, hardly imagined consequences for the\n                future of life on earth.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To undo the damage already done, and indeed, to prevent further ravages, a great leap of the\n                imagination, and a profound act of collective willpower is called for. For some years, the ecology\n                movement has done much to draw attention to the issues at stake and few people can claim\n                ‘that we didn't know’.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cities are for people and it is all of us who have to realise that our future, or more precisely that\n                of our children, is in jeopardy. To make cities and urban living ecologically viable is thus\n                becoming an utmost priority. All living beings are profoundly engaged in securing the future of\n                their offspring, and it is time that an urban humanity does the same.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The slogan of the 'greening of the cities' has been catching on in recent years, but all too often it\n                is meant mainly to create more green spaces, i.e., to improve the look of the urban fabric. It is of\n                course important to create a pleasant, greener, urban environment for people to live in. But that\n                can only be the start.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                It will be crucially important to fundamentally reorganise the metabolism of cities – the\n                throughput of raw materials, energy, consumer goods and the treatment of wastes – from the\n                perspective of long-term ecological viability. We cannot afford to continue with a pattern of linear\n                input and output which makes the routine generation of poisonous wastes a 'normal' activity.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                This is not the place to go into technical or organisational detail as regards the reorganisation of\n                the urban metabolism. But there's no doubt that a move from a linear to a circular urban\n                metabolism is one of the greatest challenges of the modern era.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Metabolism","import React from 'react';\nimport './Ecology.scss';\n\nclass Ecology extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"ecology\">\n                <div className=\"ecologyBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Ecology, Energy and Planning</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image ecologyImage\"></div>\n                    <p> It has become apparent that in a human context ecology is rather an elusive creature which has\n                        a habit of playing hide and seek with those who try to pin it down. Unlike with plants and\n                        animals, our impacts on the global environment transcend the purely biological context,\n                        depending on who we have become regarding our technological and cultural development. In\n                        ecological terms, a hunter-gatherer or a peasant farmer is not the same creature as a member\n                        of an urban-industrial society. And we seem to find it hard to make up our minds whether we\n                        regard ourselves as part of nature or as supra-natural beings, not really knowing where nature\n                        ends and where culture starts.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>This situation is vividly illustrated when we look at the statistics of our energy consumption: It is\n                    reckoned that by the 1960s every European used at least 80 ‘energy slaves’, the energy\n                    equivalent to the muscle power of 80 strong men using hand tools. Of course, this energy is\n                    mostly supplied by fossil fuels. The rest of the world is aspiring to similar levels of per capita\n                    energy consumption. In developing countries, fossil fuels use is invariably increasing as part of\n                    economic and urban growth. The decolonialisation of Third World countries is speeding up\n                    industrialisation in the quest for greater affluence, and demands redistribution of the world's\n                    resources of which we consume such an unequal share.</p>\n                <p>\n                But what about our environmental impacts? If we consume 80 times as much energy as our\n                ‘natural' ancestors, each of us has as much environmental impact in one year as they had in 80\n                years. We’d better think carefully about our actions, particularly those that affect the\n                environment in irreversible ways. Surely this is a persuasive argument for keeping built-in on\n                obsolescence out of our buildings and our settlements.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Our current lifestyles are possible only by us grabbing deeply into the pockets of other nations\n                and of future generations. The latter can't fight back, but the former – as liberation wars and raw\n                material cartels have shown – will now want to supply raw materials to us on their terms,\n                potentially with considerable consequences for Western levels of production and consumption.\n                After the oil crisis of 1973, the precarious state of Western economies is witness to the changing\n                balance of world economic power. In the USA, President Carter's energy-saving program, and\n                the demand by Third World nations for a new world economic order, are two sides of the same\n                coin. It could significantly reduce inequality between nations, with the potential for substantial\n                impacts on global economic development patterns.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cultures that consume 80 times the energy available to them from sustainable natural sources\n                must surely be living on borrowed time. We mut should revise the ingrained concept of\n                seemingly inevitable economic growth, and take the idea of creating steady-state economies\n                seriously. This certainly has major implications for employment and production patterns.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The sustainability of our lifestyles and of our settlements must surely be high on the list of our\n                priorities. It seems to me that it is high time to shed our short-term priorities for long-term,\n                ecologically defined perspectives. The only way we can do justice to future generations is to\n                define ways of using resources in ways that will be of long-lasting benefit. This means building\n                settlement structures which future generations will be glad to inhabit and to inherit from us.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In which way, then, should ecological considerations influence settlement planning? First of all,\n                this means no longer being subservient to short-term profit and loss accounting criteria, ignoring\n                the wasteful use of non-renewable resources. And it also means assuring a 'closer fit’ between\n                a given culture and its geographical and climatic setting, prioritising the use of local ‘income\n                energy’ sources over reliance on precarious, long-distance energy supplies.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ecological impact of a given culture is above all else determined by its 'metabolism', its\n                throughput of resources, and therefore resource productivity is a crucial factor. But productivity\n                planning is not ‘neutral’: ecological impacts are strongly influenced by the underlying ideology of\n                production, i.e., production for quick profit versus production for long-term use value. The latter\n                must surely gain in strategic importance.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                Ecological development planning cannot flourish in a vacuum. It must take the status quo as a\n                starting point, including prevailing employment patterns, production levels and settlement\n                structures. Even if we bring about a rapid reduction of our level of energy consumption and\n                productivity, our impacts on the global environment and future generations will continue to be\n                massive. We must therefore urgently focus our attention above all else on planning and\n                investment decisions that are likely to have long-lasting ecological and social benefits. We must\n                develop and propose plausible alternatives, and then appeal to the public for support.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To some extent the Town and Country Planning Association is already doing this. It has put\n                innovative concepts for settlement planning firmly on the public policy agenda. As people\n                demand more sustainable homes and more space to exist on, it should make sure that\n                ecological concepts are seen as a non-negotiable frame of reference. In this context the Garden\n                City guidelines proposed by Ebenezer Howard and championed by the TCPA are still highly\n                relevant. His ideas on the more even distribution of the population on a given land surface are\n                implicitly ecological, and are relevant today as much as they were 70 years ago.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The question who we humans are in ecological terms is closely linked to the places where we\n                live and, and how we live in them. The need for our settlements to be sustainable as regards\n                our use of energy and raw materials should be regarded as non-negotiable, embedding\n                development and settlement planning in the context of global ecological and economic\n                relationships. There are surely limits to our use of resources, and particularly energy resources.\n                In particular: can urban planners look to the prudent use of income energies (sun, wind, hydro,\n                geo-thermal, biofuels) as the predominant energy supply for our settlements?\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Ecology","import React from 'react';\nimport './Nighttrain.scss';\n\nclass Nighttrain extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"nightTrain\">\n                <div className=\"nightTrainBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Night Train to Xi’an</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image nightTrainImage\"></div>\n                    <p>\n                    Shanghai Railway Station is a place like no other. The whole of the population of this vast city seems\n                    to want to travel at the same time. And not just people, but people with bundles and packages the\n                    size of people, queuing up at ticket counters, squeezing through turnstiles, with grandma and\n                    grandchild in tow.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Just where is the platform I am looking for, and where is the train that will take me to Xi’an? There\n                    are so many parts to this station and the Chinese characters on the signs are a riddle. After much\n                    trial and error I find the train I have been looking for, but locating my compartment is a challenge\n                    that is almost beyond me. Eventually, gesture language and a few words from my electronic\n                    dictionary do the trick, and a helpful conductor shows me the way to the compartment where I have\n                    booked a bunk. Hello! A young girl with a pleasant moon face will be my companion on this journey.\n                    We won’t be able to talk a lot, but we can smile. She offers me exotic looking homemade biscuits\n                    and I respond by giving her pieces of chocolate that I have in my bag.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                This is called a night train, but right now it is still afternoon. The train starts with a judder and it sets\n                out on its journey out of the bowels Shanghai. I could have caught a plane but I have chosen to go by\n                train because I want to see some of what has been happening to this city and this country since I was\n                last here ten years ago. And as the train slowly creeps through the city, I catch glimpses of what has\n                been happening. Millions of people have come here to live in the sky. They have arrived here by the\n                millions from villages somewhere else to move into high rise apartment. They operate cranes, drive\n                trucks, sweep the streets, drive taxis, aiming to earn some yuans for their families back home and to\n                become consumers of Chinese-made goods. And they keep coming.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There is little evidence now of the farms in the city that one could see just a decade ago. Concrete is\n                the new normal, the soil out of which Shanghai grew over the centuries is just a platform now, on\n                which to erect blocks of flat and office buildings, flyovers and factories. And then there are the\n                power stations and their vast concrete cooling tower. And there are factories and more factories,\n                with row upon row of shiny new cars parked outside, ready to find a buyer. Well, this is just a\n                modern city, isn’t it, but what a city – London is just a little town by comparison. Nobody really\n                knows whether it is 20 or even 25 million people who live here now. But this not an American city\n                either – there aren’t really any suburbs with family homes and space for a lawn and a garage for two\n                or three cars.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The train to Xi’an is not in a hurry. Maybe the driver gets tired ever so often and needs a rest. We\n                keep being overtaken by the whoosh of sleek white trains that look like planes without wings. They\n                purposefully glide by carrying business people and party officials who have better things to do than\n                park in railway sidings. But going slow, of course, you can see, you don’t just scan the world you are\n                travelling through.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We are rolling through a city that does not seem to know where to stop as it stretches into a\n                landscape where forty story apartment buildings are the norm. Thousands of them. A concrete\n                forest plugged into tarmac and flyovers, and every so often a tired looking river and a pond where\n                carp are kept for the restaurants of Shanghai. Some greenhouses here and there, some little parks\n                and playgrounds, too.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                My companion is getting bored and stretches out to sleep. I get hungry and go in the restaurant car.\n                I am able to convey somehow that a plate full of rice and veg would not come amiss. My neighbour\n                has a better chopstick technique than I do, but somehow I manage to get the food from plate to\n                mouth to stomach. Yes, out there I can see some rice paddies now among them apartment buildings\n                but they are much sparser than I remember. Greenhouses, yes, a lot of veggies are still grown\n                around the city, the Chinese like their stir fry fresh and not wilted – better to grow them close by.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We have travelled two hours, and innumerable high rise blocks are still rising into the hazy sky, thin\n                pencil-like structures with lifts instead of corridors. This is truly vertical living, not like the pavements\n                full of chatter and children’s play back home in the village. China has come a long way, from village\n                to mega city, from tending goats on steep hill sides to living high in the sky, from growing crops by\n                hand to making toys and kettles for Wal-Mart and Tesco somewhere across the ocean. China is\n                making things for the world to make things happen at home. Mao’s vision of a village future is a\n                distant memory in this ultimate of developing countries.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Just over a hundred years ago the world as a whole had as many people as China has today. This is\n                an issue that I brood on as the night draws in. But back then people had only just started burning\n                coal and gas and oil, and building cities to chew up the world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                My companion has woken up again. She is keen to practice the few words of English she speaks.\n                ‘Have you family’ she asks and I explain that I do. ‘Have you children?’ Again I say that I do. ‘How\n                many children’, she asks as she looks down at her belly and I suddenly realise that she is pregnant.\n                She looks at me and says, ‘I … only one.’ It takes me a moment or two to realise what she means … in\n                China most people will only ever have one child. She is gently rubbing her belly greeting the child she\n                is carrying inside.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Outside in the corridor mums and dads are walking up and down, queuing up to give their kids a\n                wash, ready for bed in the confines of the sleeper. A boy is clutching his dad’s mobile to watch one\n                last cartoon. Dad doesn’t have to think of a story to tell him and can have a chat with his neighbour\n                in the compartment instead. Darkness spreads its wings across the land of China as our train\n                continues its night journey.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Next morning we are in a different land. Small towns and farms, fields of maize and crops I haven’t\n                seen before. An abundance of young trees, planted by directive of the communist party central\n                committee. China has done a tremendous amount in recent years to reforest denuded land, to hold\n                the soil in place, to supply fruit and nuts and even to create new Panda habitats. Liling, she say that\n                is her name, tries to talk to me again. ‘I have new house, in Xi’an. I live 38 th floor high rise. Can see all\n                the country from there, mountains and river. Have new kitchen, buying new sofa next week. Have\n                already got baby bed.’\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The train keeps shuddering to a halt, and then speeding again, well, maybe 100 km per hour. No sign\n                now of the fast trains we saw closer to Shanghai. We can see farmers tending their orchards, they\n                have wrapped each individual apple in a plastic bag, right there on the branches of the trees. They\n                sell their perfect apples on stalls by the road side, beautiful ripe fruit, apples and pomegranates. I\n                wish I could buy a bag or two.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                As we turn a corner some huge buildings suddenly spring into view, dozens of them, some already\n                completed, others still with cranes hovering above them. Vast concrete structures, each will\n                probably accommodate 1000 people or more. It seems that in China there is little concern about\n                whether high rise living is a good idea or not. That is how most people are going to live, period. Each\n                building comes with its own electricity supply, air conditioning system, rubbish shoots, nurseries and\n                cafes. If you have more money than average you may live in a little house of your own somewhere in\n                the suburbs, maybe even an SUV in the garage, but don’t bet on it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                ‘Here, that is house where I live, up there, see.’ Liling points to one among thousands of windows\n                nearly at the top of a huge building. ‘My mother coming for visit tomorrow. So happy.’\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Xian unfolds in front of our eyes, as we glide through vast fields of wheat and corn and more\n                orchards. As we pull into Xi’an’s railway station and it is time to say goodbyes, I ask Liling whether\n                she has given ‘the only one’ a name as yet. She smiles and says, just ‘happy future’ and she explains\n                that this could be the name for a boy or a girl. I make my way to the hotel I have booked, and within\n                a couple of hours I catch a taxi to the terracotta warriors, the reason that most visitors undertake\n                the journey to Xi’an. It is a long trek through traffic jams on elevated motorways past more high rise\n                buildings and many buildings sporting the Chinese flag. I read that Xi’an has more people than\n                London. The city is all new, and so are the cars crowding the streets.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But, of course, the warriors are anything but new, over 2000 years old, and only discovered by\n                farmers digging for water some 40 years ago. They have become one of the great emblems of\n                modern China. A whole new town has sprung up around the warrior exhibit. Every Chinese seems to\n                wants to make the pilgrimage at least once in their lives. And there, under the cover of massive\n                roofs, the clay soldiers guarding the tomb of emperor Qin Shi Huang stand lined up, hundreds of\n                them. It is a magnificent sight and in addition to the soldiers, a few terracotta horses have also been\n                dug up intact.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But what a difference between an ancient terracotta army and modern China. No horses here, but\n                innumerable cars on brand new streets. This is a new world, one that even the last great emperor,\n                Mao Tse Tung, could not have envisaged. Think about it: Today China has about the same population\n                as the whole world just a century ago, 1.3 billion people. And each Chinese today has vast quantities\n                of coal and oil fuelled energy at their disposal, six times as much as they would have had a century\n                ago. China now releases more carbon dioxide than any other country in the world. The\n                transformation is total.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The current Chinese government has proclaimed that it is now working towards an ecological\n                society, but can that mean a future where every one of the tens of thousands of high rise building\n                requires a continuous electricity supply to assure that the lifts in all those buildings keep working? I\n                wonder what all this means for the future.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                I leave China with more questions than answers. The country is on a high like few others have ever\n                been before. The people look confident and one sees a lot of smiles on their faces. Liling is looking\n                forward to a healthy child, and a happy to them both. But as China grows into a giant, with India,\n                Vietnam and Indonesia close behind, wanting their share of the spoils, can the living planet cope?\n                This needs to be a future for all the world, and I can only hope that it will be a happy one.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Nighttrain","import React from 'react';\nimport './UrbanSystems.scss';\n\nclass UrbanSystems extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"urbanSystems\">\n                <div className=\"urbanSystemsBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Urban systems and their impacts</h3>\n                <div className=\"mainText\">\n                    <div className=\"image urbanSystemsImage\"></div>\n                    <p>We now live in the age of the city, with well over\n                        50 per cent of the global human population\n                        being urban, and this figure is expected\n                        to reach 68 per cent by 2050.\n                        1\n                        Cities are inherently\n                        dependent systems, as their functioning relies on\n                        supplies of a large variety of resources from beyond\n                        their built-up territory, most notably food, water and\n                        wood products.

This can arguably result\n                            in some sustainability benefits, particularly with\n                            regard to transport efficiencies. But as they grow\n                            into preeminent centres of national economies and\n                            of popular consumerism, cities develop ever-larger\n                            global ecological footprints. In developing countries,\n                            as villages and small towns grow into large cities,\n                            their per-capita resource consumption can increase\n                            three to four times due to increased incomes and the\n                            ready availability of fossil fuels and manufactured\n                            products.

For an urbanising world to have a long-term\n                            future, cities need to develop a circular metabolism,\n                            as suggested in Figure 1. This change, of course, has\n                            to be driven by appropriate policy measures.\n                        </p>\n                        <p className=\"figureText\">Figure 1.

I have summarised\n                their development with respect to their resource\n                dependencies into three distinct phases.2</p>\n                <p>Agropolis. The traditional town, in the absence of\n                well-developed transport links, had essentially agrarian\n                roots. Energy supply, and resource use and reuse, were\n                necessarily localised. The town was reliant on crop and\n                livestock farming systems that were peripheral to the\n                settlement (see Figure 2).</p>\n                <div className=\"image figure2\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Figure 2. This diagram draws on the work of the 19th-century geographer Heinrich von Thünen. Agropolis is embedded\n                in a horticultural and agricultural hinterland. Its existence depends on a continuous give-and-take: reaping an annual\n                harvest for its inhabitants in exchange for returning human and animals waste back to the land. (© Herbert Girardet\n                and Rick Lawrence)</p>\n                <p>This model required a well-developed understanding\n                of the conditions for sustainable interaction with\n                supporting natural systems, such as soil husbandry,\n                crop cultivation, the uses of farm animals, and water\n                management. Of necessity it was based on an inherently\n                circular metabolic arrangement: long-term viability\n                necessitated that organic waste from within the city,\n                with its associated nutrient and carbon content, was\n                returned for productive use in the surrounding land.</p>\n                <p>Petropolis. The modern city, in contrast, represents a\n                different urban reality. It is powered for all its functions by non-renewable fossil fuels, and food and other essential\n                resources are brought in from remote locations rather\n                than from places peripheral to the city. Its fundamental\n                existential dependence on daily petrochemical\n                inputs (to resource supply, manufacturing and\n                transport) results in a problematic relationship to the\n                world’s ecosystems. So the existence of today’s cities\n                is dependent on huge amounts of resources drawn\n                through worldwide supply chains and over-extensive\n                ecological areas. This situation creates a one-way\n                flow of plant nutrients from distant ecosystems that\n                are not then replenished at source. The impacts of\n                greenhouse gas emissions and prevailing extractive\n                practices lead to climate change and the progressive\n                loss of soil productivity and biodiversity in the source\n                ecosystems (see Figure 3).</p>\n                <div className=\"image figure3\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Figure 3. The modern city, Petropolis, depends on massive daily inputs of non-renewable fossil fuels for all its\n                internal functions as well as its external transport connections. Critically, food is often brought in from distant\n                locations, causing cities to have vast global ecological footprints. This future of this kind of urbanisation looks highly\n                problematic.

The lack of cyclic systems then results\n                in fertiliser run-off, and slurry and sewage pollution in\n                rivers, causing excess nitrification.</p>\n                <p>As just one of many, almost uniform, global examples,\n                18th-century London was largely fed from its hinterland,\n                but as it grew, it became ever-more dependent on remote\n                sources of food and nutrients. A major downside of a\n                world in which Petropolis has become dominant is\n                that it is profoundly vulnerable to disruptions across a\n                broad spectrum of supporting ecosystems, geopolitical\n                regions and supply chains.</p>\n                <p>Ecopolis. This new urban paradigm has to be the model\n                of the nature-compatible city of the future. It should not\n                be regarded as a retrograde concept, but one of dynamic\n                innovation and progress. Fossil-fuel dependence\n                will give way to efficient use of renewable energy\n                technologies. And, crucially, the urban system needs\n                to be designed to be compatible with its supporting ecosystems, so as to develop a regenerative, circular\n                metabolism (see Figure 4). This entails emulating the\n                circularity of natural ecosystems, recycling waste\n                resources from human consumption back into the\n                environment where they are safely reintegrated and\n                regenerated through natural processes. Among other\n                measures, this entails applying the nutrients and carbon\n                contained in human excrement and organic wastes to\n                the farmland supplying food to cities. Recycled plastics\n                from the urban waste stream would be used in road\n                construction and other long-life infrastructure. The\n                emphasis is on ceasing the linear ‘take, take, take’\n                model of the modern economy and learning from\n                nature about the necessity of cyclic systems for the\n                achievement of sustainability.</p>\n                <div className=\"image figure4\"></div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Figure 4. A viable future for an urbanising world depends on cities using their built-up spaces and their hinterland to\n                supply energy that is 100 per cent renewable and food that is local and regenerative. Ecopolis mimics the circularity\n                of natural ecosystems, which would be embedded both in both ecological and economic practices of cities.

Wilson3\n                and others, that reflects the\n                innate human attraction to nature and natural processes\n                built up through an evolutionary history of living in forested and agrarian settings. Rather, it suggests an\n                ecophilia approach, which is broader based and takes into\n                account the wider issue of the reliance of cities on distant\n                ecosystems. Thus natural processes are embedded into\n                the interactions between people and ecosystems, and\n                are supported to create a regenerative urban agenda\n                and economic model of progress.</p>\n                <p>The entire metabolism of cities needs to be taken into\n                account: biophysical, technical, industrial and even\n                financial. There is a pressing need to think and develop\n                urban systems on the basis of nature’s cyclic processes:\n                the carbon, nutrient and water cycles. This applies to all\n                areas of human activity, including the need to account\n                for the wider geographical dependencies on water drawn\n                from distant, upstream catchments, and the supply\n                chains of food and other resources consumed by the\n                urban metabolism. The Ecopolis concept can also form\n                the basis for a new, resilient green urban economy,\n                particularly for city regions currently caught in the\n                downward spiral of depression and poverty as former\n                industrial activities fall into decline.</p>\n                <p>There is nothing regressive about this change in\n                paradigm. The innovative and forward-looking cyclic\n                city thinks in terms of innovation as a basis for greater\n                security and greater liveability for its citizens. A novel\n                green economy, championing all aspects of regenerative\n                development, would offer livelihoods to large numbers\n                of people. It would convert organic waste into productive\n                compost and recycle industrial waste into material of\n                value for long-term uses. It would switch to regionally\n                autonomous renewable systems instead of relying on\n                dwindling, expensive and polluting fossil fuels drawn\n                from remote and often politically problematic regions.\n                It may, for example, conceive of drawing on methane\n                from sewage for power generation, as Bristol did with\n                its innovative ‘poo buses’. The urban food system would\n                become more localised and less reliant on high-energy\n                inputs and international supply chains.</p>\n                <p>Pertinent urban examples of such transformations include\n                concrete measures already implemented in Adelaide,\n                Australia, where measures towards mainstreaming water\n                efficiency, circular waste management, reforestation and\n                renewable energy have created a very substantial new\n                green economy. This transition, aimed at South Australia\n                becoming a sustainable region, was based on a 32-point\n                plan that I put to the Australian government\n                4\n                and is\n                discussed as a case study in the article ‘Cities with a\n                plan’. Further global exemplars of urban evolutions\n                are seen in the Welsh government’s Our Valleys, Our\n                Future programme,\n                5\n                India’s Smart City Mission,6 South\n\n                Korea’s fourth industrial revolution,\n                7\n                and the USA’s\n                stimulus policies for renewable energy, including under\n                the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>\n                <h4>Challenges and Solutions</h4>\n                <p>Urban societies today tend to have a profound lack of\n                understanding about the impacts of their demands and\n                actions. For instance, there is little understanding about\n                how clean water is available on tap, and wastewater is\n                flushed away with no sense of connection with water\n                catchments that are both sources and sinks. In business,\n                too, fresh water supply and wastewater disposal are\n                generally conceived as matters of commercial transaction\n                with water service companies, with little understanding\n                of them as natural resource dependencies.</p>\n                <p>The same can generally be said of food chains and their\n                associated waste streams, often procuring out-of-season\n                or other cheaply produced crops together with their\n                constituent nutrient, carbon and energy content through\n                long international supply chains. Ironically, while global\n                society heads towards peak phosphorus – global demand\n                outstripping exploitable supplies – we also suffer a surfeit\n                of nutrient pollution of fresh waters and in coastal dead\n                zones as well as farming methods that drive loss of soil\n                fertility and biodiversity. As one pertinent example: the\n                nutrient content of soya beans grown on former forest\n                soils in the Brazilian Amazon, and then procured on\n                international markets, significantly contribute to pig\n                manure pollution of the China’s Yangtze River, in turn\n                contaminating the water supplies of those who consume\n                these pork products.</p>\n                <p>But there is now an increasing awareness of these\n                matters from media reports. For instance, television\n                documentaries highlighting the accumulation of\n                single-use plastic items in the oceans, leading to the\n                strangling of turtles and dolphins, triggered a strong\n                emotional reaction in the general public, which helped to\n                kick start some initial regulatory responses and business\n                innovation. Reconnection of urban societies with their\n                environmental dependencies and impacts is vital to\n                stimulate proportionate responses.</p>\n                <p>Creating regenerative cities is a pressing priority in the\n                urban world we are building, which is synonymous\n                with the Anthropocene era. Biological and technical\n                regeneration must necessarily work hand in hand, and\n                the metabolism of cities must both re-localise but also\n                develop sustainable, cyclic relationships with the broader hinterlands upon which they ultimately depend for\n                their sustenance.</p>\n                <p>By and large, Ecopolis is still a vision in the making, but\n                a necessary one, as human numbers and urbanisation\n                continue to boom. We and our cities are, after all, living\n                entities with metabolisms that are umbilically connected\n                with this planet’s supportive ecosystems.</p>\n                <h4>References:</h4>\n                <p>\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n                        (2018) 68% of the world population projected to live in urban\n                        areas by 2050, says UN. https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html (Accessed: 19 June 2020).</li>\n                        <li>Girardet, H.

As in\n                    many European and US cities, the industries upon which\n                    the city’s wealth had been founded were in decline,\n                    causing unemployment and social tensions. And the\n                    Murray–Darling River, draining around one-seventh of\n                    the continent’s land mass and serving as South Australia’s\n                    main source of water, was in serious decline in terms\n                    both of water quantity and quality, due to multiple\n                    demands from agriculture and urban consumption, as\n                    well as the effects of a warming climate. This threatened\n                    not merely the security of water supply, but also of food\n                    and energy.\n                        \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p className=\"figureText\">Figure 1. In 2018, South Australia commissioned Tesla to install a 130 MV lithium battery system, then the world’s\n                largest, to smooth out the renewable energy supply from its wind farms and solar roofs.

In 2003, the government of South Australia\n                took the bold decision to initiate a thinkers-in-residence\n                programme, inviting researchers from around the world\n                to examine the situation and make proposals for change.\n                I (Herbie Girardet) was the first thinker to be invited, and\n                my task was to explore how South Australia’s economy\n                could be put on a sustainable footing: how water, food\n                and resource efficiency and renewable energy could\n                become the basis of a new green economy.</p>\n                <p>It quickly became apparent that the region was making\n                very inefficient use of resources and that it was necessary\n                to examine its ‘metabolism’. How could an inefficient,\n                petrochemically dependent urban model, with its many\n                associated vulnerabilities, be replaced? How could new\n                opportunities be found for new smart technologies and\n                greener jobs? The focus of the work was not just Adelaide\n                itself, with a population of 1.2 million, but the whole of\n                South Australia, with its 1.7 million people.</p>\n                <p>The very special situation I found was that both the\n                premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, and his entire\n                cabinet and much of the civil service backed my work.\n                In innumerable seminars over a 10-week period,\n                people from all sectors of South Australia’s society\n                came together to discuss future prospects. It was soon\n                clear that no single institution alone could achieve the\n                systemic transformation needed, extending as it did\n                beyond the authority, remit and perspective of each\n                sector. Academics, non-governmental organisations\n                (NGOs), politicians, business leaders, trade unionists\n                and civil servants all came together to create a\n                coherent vision for change. It became possible to\n                develop deep, new partnerships and share learning\n                across all affected bodies.</p>\n                <p>At the end of my stay, in May 2003, I submitted a\n                32-point plan called Creating a Sustainable Adelaide. This\n                was examined by a cabinet committee and eventually \n                approved in its entirety. It led to a multi-stakeholder\n                implementation process to make substantial advances\n                in building a substantial green economy for Adelaide\n                and, indeed, for the whole of South Australia.1</p>\n                <h4>Green outcomes achieved</h4>\n                <p> Seventeen years from its inception, outcomes of\n                the work span multiple dimensions. The region\n                has achieved greatly enhanced water and energy\n                renewability. Its electricity system now boasts 60\n                per cent renewable supply from wind and solar,\n                and the world’s largest battery has been installed to\n                deal with supply fluctuations (see Figure 1). South\n                Australia has become a living demonstration that\n                novel energy systems can form the basis of urban\n                regeneration in a post-industrial setting, displacing\n                damaging fossil-fuel-based technologies while also\n                regenerating local economies. Water-efficiency\n                measures have also been implemented across the \n                region, with wastewater recovered from treatment\n                plants used in park and farmland irrigation. Some\n                3 million trees have been planted for soil erosion\n                control and carbon sequestration. Key outcomes of\n                the new policies implemented by the South Australia\n                government are summarised below.</p>\n                <div className=\"greyBackground\">\n                    <h4>Key outcomes in South Australia</h4>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>60 per cent electricity supply from wind and solar;</li>\n                        <li>300,000 photovoltaic (PV) roofs on 600,000 houses = 600 MW peak;</li>\n                        <li>PV roofs on most public buildings;</li>\n                        <li>The world‘s largest lithium battery: 130 MW;</li>\n                        <li>Solar hot water systems mandated for new buildings;</li>\n                        <li>3 million trees planted on 2,000 ha for C02 absorption and biodiversity;</li>\n                        <li>25 per cent reduction of C02 emissions since 2000;</li>\n                        <li>Water-sensitive urban development;</li>\n                        <li>Substantial extension of its tram system and its cycle lanes;</li>\n                        <li>180,000 t of compost made from urban organic waste;</li>\n                        <li>20,000 ha of peri-urban land used for vegetable and fruit crops;</li>\n                        <li>Reclaimed wastewater and urban compost used to cultivate that land;</li>\n                        <li>Large-scale programmes to improve the energy performance of buildings across the region;</li>\n                        <li>60 per cent CO2 emissions reduction by municipal buildings;</li>\n                        <li>Construction of Lochiel Park green village, with 106 eco-homes;</li>\n                        <li>and Thousands of new green jobs.2</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n                <p>The prospect of creating a major new green jobs\n                sector was one of the primary triggers that influenced change by the government. Policy stimuli towards\n                the development of an increasingly cyclical urban\n                economy have proven to be a profitable enabler of\n                progress towards sustainability. Regulation, markets,\n                technological innovation, targeted impartial advice\n                and other measures have all achieved demonstrable\n                progress. In all this, government agencies have\n                played key roles in establishing frameworks for\n                cross-sectoral collaboration to achieve clearly framed,\n                desirable outcomes.</p>\n                <p>Adelaide has also become an exemplar of what can\n                be done to reconnect a city to its hinterland. Stimuli\n                towards large-scale urban fringe agriculture and\n                viticulture are also an integral part of the local scene.\n                Progress made in Adelaide, and South Australia as\n                a whole, demonstrates the powers of a collaborative\n                approach extending beyond the authority, remit and\n                perspective of any single societal sector.</p>\n                <p>South Australia now sets a global standard for\n                the rebuilding of post-industrial city-regions and\n                economies, based on the cyclical and efficient use of\n                waste, water, food and energy, and the development of\n                novel technologies. Cumulatively, these demonstrate\n                the benefits of a more sustainable, or indeed\n                regenerative, greener economy. Adelaide stands as the\n                tangible and successful basis for transferrable lessons\n                for the future development of other city-regions across\n                the world.</p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default CitiesPlan","import React from 'react';\nimport './UrbanTransitions.scss';\n\nclass UrbanTransitions extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"urbanTransitions\">\n                <div className=\"urbanTransitionsBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Urban Transitions</h3>\n                <p>This interview was conducted by Prof. Marilyne Andersen, MIT, \n                    at the Urban Transitions Global Summit in\n                    Shanghai on 10.

The relationship between the way we live in our human settlements and\n                        the world beyond must become much more pro-active.</p>\n                        <p>“Sustainable” is also a term that is both corrupted and grossly overused. There are many other terms that can\n                        be used to define the way we should manage our cities – such as liveable, resilient, smart, intelligent and\n                        responsible, for instance. I prefer to use the term “regenerative”. Regenerative cities are environmentally-\n                        enhancing, restorative urban systems that maintain a responsible relationship with the natural resources on\n                        which they depend.

Cities are, in fact, dependent systems, relying upon ecosystem\n                services somewhere out there. It’s not good enough to simply look at a city in terms of its morphology as\n                planners tend to do; we need to take a closer look at the linkages - pipes and cables connecting the city to the\n                wider hinterland, the power stations, and food and water sources.</p>\n                <p>The 19 th century German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen 1 showed that in the absence of major road,\n                canal or river transport systems, cities had to ensure steady food and timber supplies from close by. They had\n                to give back in order to survive. There had to be a give and take between human settlements and their\n                hinterlands. I refer to this traditional type of human settlement, as “Agropolis”</p>\n                <p>We don’t live in the Agropolis anymore; we live in “Petropolis” the city powered by fossil fuels from global\n                sources. It all started with the Industrial Revolution. Today, with access to resources across the planet - at least\n                in the global North - we take but don’t give back very much. That is one of the most critical issues in an\n                urbanizing world. We need to understand that we must look beyond physical structures towards processes\n                found in natural ecosystems and replace our current, inefficient linear system of resource extraction and waste\n                disposal with a resource-efficient circular urban metabolism.</p>\n                <p>A massive daily injection of stored sunlight, in the form of coal, oil and gas, is the primary condition for\n                making contemporary urban systems possible. This is the key issue we now have to deal with. Of course,\n                individual consumers cannot be expected to spearhead modern, eco-friendly, responsible lifestyles. In order to\n                spark the significant changes that are needed in the energy and resource performance of our cities, we need\n                national policies that go beyond existing perspectives.</p>\n                <p>New technical options do exist and must be driven by policy, particularly when it comes to wind and solar\n                power and energy storage. Yet, even with rapidly implementing ever cheaper novel energy technologies\n                that are now becoming available, we still won’t be able to lower atmospheric carbon concentrations. We can only do that by finding various ways to sequester carbon, preferably by natural means like reforestation\n                and carbon storage in soils. Yet, at the same time, forests in many places are on fire, or dying due to climate\n                stress and disease-related issues. This is a very worrying development.</p>\n                <p>The challenge we now face is that of turning our cities into ecologically and economically-restorative\n                systems. In my view we need to move into a new kind of city, which I call “Ecopolis”. There are many\n                existing cities around the world that could be made to run on efficient, renewable energy systems and to\n                actively reconnect them to their local hinterland. Some cities have already moved strongly in this direction.\n                In this context, energy democracy is an interesting issue to discuss: no longer relying on mega power station\n                monopolies but implementing a much more democratic “prosumer” approach wherein consumers can also\n                become energy producers.</p>\n                <h4>How do you envision the role of buildings between now and 2050?</h4>\n                <p>From World War II onwards, fossil fuel energy was so freely available that people didn’t worry much\n                about building design and its relationship to energy and the larger environment. That has obviously become\n                a major challenge, mainly due to concerns about climate change.</p>\n                <p>Optimizing the energy performances of buildings is becoming a critical issue. Passive and solar design are\n                now becoming mainstream, and technology has improved a great deal, with tremendous innovation in\n                insulation materials and solar technology. Thus, a great many new options have suddenly become available\n                and are directly relevant to the future of not only individual building construction, but the design of entire\n                cities.</p>\n                <p>Energy self-sufficient buildings or energy+ buildings are no longer just a theory; they’re a reality. However,\n                we mustn’t limit ourselves to buildings’ energy performances alone. First and foremost, buildings are places\n                where people want to enjoy life. So how architecture responds to that is another big issue.</p>\n                <p>I think there is also renewed interest in community gardens, which were both popular and a necessity in the\n                19 th century in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries. Back then, people - who often had\n                migrated from villages to urban areas - wanted to keep growing some of their own food for their families. I\n                believe intra- and peri-urban farming and gardening is essential for the future of urban food supplies.\n                Emerging technology-driven options also undoubtedly provide relevant tools, like vertical farming which can\n                be done in old factory buildings and does not necessarily require purpose-built greenhouses.</p>\n                <h4>What are the major obstacles to achieving energy-efficient or active buildings?</h4>\n                <p>Taking the example of the BedZED 2 project, the first of its kind in Britain, cost overruns were a significant\n                issue, partly because it introduced new features that had to be specially designed for the project. Generally\n                speaking, initial investments for high-performance projects pose problems, even if operating costs are lower\n                and the project will be cost-effective in the long run. However, Passivhaus design is quickly becoming cost-\n                competitive with conventional design. Still, we need more policies and incentives. The market alone cannot\n                solve the problem.</p>\n                <h4>Can you give us some examples of your own work that has contributed to the field?</h4>\n                <p>In 2003, I was invited to be a ‘Thinker in Residence’ in Adelaide, Australia. The goal was to come up with\n                proposals for improving the efficiency of an energy/resource-intensive city region of some 1.3 million people,\n                and, crucially, to help create a substantial new green economy. In a very intense 10-week period I held daily\n                seminars and lectures with people from all sectors of society. I came up with a 32-point plan, 31 of which \n                were implemented within a few months 3 . These included measures for energy-efficient retrofitting of\n                buildings, large-scale tree planting, water security measures, sustainable transport policies, 100% organic\n                waste recycling and support for peri-urban agriculture. Subsequently, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy\n                were added and Adelaide now has over 50% electricity supplies from wind and solar technology.\n                Ultimately, we were able to achieve a remarkable, regenerative urban transformation, moving actively\n                towards creating a circular metabolism whilst creating thousands of new green jobs.</p>\n                <p>More recently, I was also involved in a project called Dongtan Eco-City on Chongming Island, in the\n                Yangtze delta. The Shanghai city government wanted to build a city that would not pollute the island,\n                which is largely farmland and home to a bird sanctuary. The plan was to build an eco-city for half a million\n                people by 2030. I was working as a consultant for Arup 4 , the multinational engineering firm. The idea was\n                to design an Ecopolis that would be largely powered by renewable energy, would be car-free, where waste\n                water would be recycled and reused for irrigation, and that would have a circular metabolism. The Ecopolis\n                was to be built on farmland, yet without reducing the total amount of produce grown on that land.\n                Unfortunately, the project did not come to fruition for political reasons.</p>\n                <h4>Who are the key initiators of change? Are new professions to emerge or roles to evolve?</h4>\n                <p>Back in the United Kingdom I was involved in introducing feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy. That had a\n                dramatic effect on the uptake of renewable energy – especially solar – at the local level. This experience\n                highlights the importance of appropriate national policies, which I believe are key to creating a world of\n                regenerative cities. The market itself is lazy! It doesn’t want to innovate unless it’s for profit and, by itself, is\n                not fit to create truly liveable and environmentally compatible cities.</p>\n                <p>Back in the United Kingdom I was involved in introducing feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy.

Environmentally-conscious behavior patterns are still difficult to\n                instil in people, but we’re slowly getting there. We are now ‘amplified’ by technology – I use the term\n                ‘amplified man’ – with our reliance on ever technologies and gadgets. Although many devices have become\n                ever smaller and more energy-efficient, we use more of them than ever before – cars, washing machines, cell\n                phones, industrial robots, etc. Greater awareness of our impacts is badly needed. Informing users of the full\n                impacts of our lifestyles is a key driver of change.</p>\n                <p>In terms of professions, I believe the role of engineers is becoming more important. Civil engineering is\n                evolving and taking a growing interest in ecology and the metabolism of cities. All major engineering firms\n                like ARUP, for instance, now have ecology departments. The latter are still smaller than other departments,\n                like structural engineering, but they’re growing rapidly.</p>\n                <p>The whole environmental consultancy field has grown a great deal in recent years. When I first started in\n                this, it was hard to make a living. Nowadays, you see ads for ecological and environmental engineering\n                positions everywhere. These are encouraging signs. Still, change can be further speeded up by appropriate\n                policies.</p>\n                <p>A crucial driver for making an energy and regenerative development turnaround happen is to realize that\n                there is huge economic potential in these sectors. This became very evident in my work in Adelaide. A lot of\n                cities have suffered from job losses due to automation, industrial relocation, etc. But energy can be supplied\n                more locally and recycling can become an integral part of the functioning of urban systems, and this means\n                that jobs can come back to the urban arena. But, again, that is something that won’t happen automatically -\n                it has to be driven by both national- and community-level enabling policies.</p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default UrbanTransitions","import React from 'react';\nimport './Energy.scss';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nclass Energy extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"energy\">\n            <div className=\"energyBanner\"></div>\n            <h3>Energy and Economics</h3>\n            <div className=\"articlesContainer\">\n                <Link to=\"/articles/energy/amplified\">\n                    <div className=\"articleCard\">\n                        <div className=\"articleImage amplifiedMan\"></div>\n                        <div className=\"articleCardText\">\n                            <div className=\"blockContainer\">\n                                <div className=\"block1\">\n                                    <p>The Amplified Man </p>\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"block2\"><p>1982</p></div>\n                            </div>\n                            <p className=\"cardDescription\"> \n                            This essay was first published in Resurgence Magazine nr. 95, November 1982, with minor\n                            revisions in 2020.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Link>\n                <Link to=\"/articles/energy/regenerative\">\n                    <div className=\"articleCard\">\n                        <div className=\"articleImage regenerativeCardImage\"></div>\n                        <div className=\"articleCardText\">\n                            <div className=\"blockContainer\">\n                                <div className=\"block1\">\n                                    <p>Regenerative economies for a sustainable world</p>\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"block2\"><p>2018</p></div>\n                            </div>\n                            <p className=\"cardDescription\">This text was written for the Club of Rome in 2018 and published by Resurgence\n                            Magazine.

I saw a\n                    young father, carrying his baby child in his arms who was standing in front of a space capsule in\n                    which two Americans had returned from the moon back to earth. 'Look', he said to the child, 'you\n                    will fly in one of these one day when you're big. I can fly through the air, but you will fly through\n                    space, between planets and moons, and think of nothing of it. And here on earth you will travel\n                    in rocket cars, have bulldozers to dig with and have computers to do your thinking for you. You\n                    will see through camera lenses and telescopes and microscopes. You will talk through\n                    microphones and listen through earphones.

He looked embarrassed when he noticed me listening\n                    to him and walked off into the next room to bring more blessings of science and technology\n                    upon himself and his child. And he left me brooding about the meaning of it all.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                I sat down in a cubicle to watch documentary film about an industrial robot that was drawing an\n                image of the first steam locomotive with his metal hand onto a large sheet of paper,\n                manipulating a magic marker. It turned into a precise drawing of the machine. The few\n                seemingly uncontrolled movements of the mechanical arm gave it a sympathetic air of\n                imperfection. But then, industrial robots are not normally used to draw pictures. Their robust\n                hands are designed to manipulate laser torches or large spanners.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The machines of the first industrial revolution were designed to multiply muscle power (steam\n                engine, petrol and diesel engine, electric motor). The second industrial revolution in the middle\n                of the 20th century introduced devices that extended the human nervous system (radio,\n                telephone, film, TV). And now the third industrial revolution, or micro-revolution, introduces\n                devices that amplify the human brain (computers, data stores, monitors).\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We still come in the physical guise of our hunter gatherer ancestors, but as regards our impact\n                on this planet we've become altogether different creatures. The brainy ape has become a\n                technological giant. And there seems to be no limit to the appetite of the amplified man: A seam\n                of coal for breakfast, the trainload of iron or for lunch, a freighter full of bauxite for dessert, and a\n                square mile of forest for supper, washed down with a tanker load of oil.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Man and Robot</h4>\n                <p>\n                Recently I saw a TV programme about a robot factory in Japan. It was a far cry from a pottery\n                shed or metal workshop of times past. During normal working hours the human workers were\n                doing maintenance on numerically controlled machine tools, supplying them with the parts\n                required for the automatic production of robots. At 6 o'clock, when the workers went home, the\n                strip lights were switched off in the factory and the robots continued making robots in the dark:\n                machines making machines, and only a few red and green control lamps were still glowing in\n                the electric factory.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                These robots are supposed to be our new servants. They are more easily programmed than\n                workers. They don't strike for better working conditions or more pay. They don't need canteens\n                to feed them, or houses to live in, or schools for their children. They can work day and night in\n                their own angular, electric world. Yes, they break down sometimes, but they don't get sick pay,\n                and neither does their ‘employer' have to make contributions towards their old age pensions.\n                A sufficient supply of electricity and materials is all that is needed to keep the robots going.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There is no doubt that as we get used to the ever-widening range of services provided by\n                robots, we will come to depend on them. They will become part of the world of the amplified\n                man like the steam engine or the electric motor have done before. It is true that robots will do\n                some very unpleasant jobs that people shouldn't do, like doing repair work in nuclear power\n                stations or operating in factories polluted with poisonous gases. But then, do we really need\n                nuclear power stations, or do we want to use lethal chemicals in our productive processes?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Industrialists and some trade unionists may agree that robots are useful in manufacture\n                because they increase productivity and help us to compete in the world market. Industrialists\n                aim to benefit from reduced payrolls by boosting profits, and trade unionists may benefit from\n                shorter working hours. And the new leisure industries are keen to pounce on anybody who's got\n                a bit of new spare time on their hands. But: what are the wider consequences of the ever-\n                increasing amplification of man? Is it leading to progressive dehumanisation? Are we becoming\n                the servants of the machines that were meant to free us from toil and drudgery?\n                </p>\n                <h4>Human Identity</h4>\n                <p>\n                An important aspect of our increasing amplification is the loss of human identity, as we become\n                a fusion of man and machine. The machines we use, directly or indirectly, are part of our being.\n                They become tools for fulfilling desires which we soon take for granted: 'Where should we go on\n                holiday this year, Greece or Portugal or Thailand?' The question how we’d get to that holiday\n                destination is barely discussed anymore: Of course, by plane! Aeroplane, train, motorcar, and\n                all the many other means of transport or production, are now part of our identity. They are\n                meant to benefit us, but they are also part of our ever-greater planetary impact.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And what about the places where we have come to live? The proverbial visitor from outer space\n                would be profoundly puzzled by cities like New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Tokyo. They\n                would probably take them for colonies of giant crystals that have grown out of the earth with\n                irresistible force. Are they habitats for us humans or are we only miniature parasites of these\n                gigantic crystalline structures: Man servicing a world of enormous quartz and silicon crystals?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The artefacts we produce in our factories have become an essential aspect of our human\n                identity. We have come to rely on them and they have become part of the internal geography of\n                our minds. They shape our attitudes to the world, and they increasingly determine our actions\n                and reactions to it. Not so long ago, when someone wanted to dig a ditch, they would have\n                thought of using a shovel as the appropriate tool. Now a mechanical digger would come to mind\n                as the ‘natural' option, the right machine for the job. And thus the mechanical digger has\n                displaced the shovel as part of the new identity of the amplified man.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                When we stand in front of a mirror to look at ourselves, we only see a tiny proportion of our true\n                amplified selves. We only see the biological part without the huge technical appendix that has\n                come to determine our identities. Thus we have become truly larger-than-life. But there is a\n                snag: the loss of certainty about who we have become is not easing the age-old question as to\n                what we are here for. And the amplification of the individual is rapidly coming into conflict with\n                the well-being and continuity of humanity.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The amplified man considers himself as master of the natural world. Nature out there has\n                become a somewhat exotic museum piece, to be preserved on videotape and in photographs –\n                a stage prop in the ever-evolving drama of modern civilisation: Forests have been degraded to\n                pulp mines; agriculture has been proclaimed an industry among other industries, just another\n                factor of production; plants and animals are being measured up simply in terms of their potential\n                yield of proteins and carbohydrates.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Quantity of consumption has become the yardstick of the hierarchy of the amplified man. The\n                most powerful individuals or nations gobble the most. They are constantly expanding their\n                economic, political and military power, and everybody else is busy trying to catch up.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                So what does the amplified man actually look like? We've seen that he is part man, part\n                machine. His tentacles stretch around the world. His breath is carbon dioxide as well as sulphur\n                dioxide and all the other waste gases he emits from his smokestacks and exhaust pipes. He has\n                human hands for pressing buttons and handling knives and forks, for operating gear levers and\n                steering columns. And he's got metal hands to operate the tools that make the things he has\n                come to depend on. He has a brain, a heart and sexual organs that are still riddled with the\n                remnants of 'primitive’, human emotions. And he has microchips grafted onto his nervous\n                system, empowering to satisfy his ever-greater ambitions.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                'The endless cycle of idea and action,\n                <br></br>\n                Endless invention, endless experiment,\n                <br></br>\n                Brings knowledge of motion but not silence,\n                <br></br>\n                knowledge of words, and ignorance of the word,\n                <br></br>\n                All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,\n                <br></br>\n                all our ignorance brings us nearer to death,\n                <br></br>\n                but nearness to death no nearer to God.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                (TS Eliot, choruses from' The Rock.)\n                </p>\n                <h4>Expansion and conquest</h4>\n                <p>\n                The modern amplified man is the greatest expansionist the world has ever seen, developing\n                ever newer ways in which to exert his power. His predecessor came on horseback, with\n                gleaming swords and suits of armour. Then he conquered with sailing ships and bronze canons.\n                Then he kitted himself out with gunboats – steamship against dugout canoe, machine gun\n                against bow and arrow. Then he asserted himself with jet planes and missiles. When\n                domination through military force became less viable, he expanded his power by use of\n                communication satellites and novel global trading systems. Manipulation of commodity and\n                currency markets have become his latest instrument of economic and political control.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Wherever his tentacles reach, he leaves trails of broken traditional cultures, their values\n                smashed, their human relationships in tatters. The heroes of his brightly coloured moving\n                pictures, projected on cinema and television screens across this planet, are everywhere\n                displacing the heroes of treasured stories that have been passed on from generation to\n                generation.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The amplified man has an insatiable appetite for power. It arises out of an insatiable quest for\n                victory in competition, any competition. A fist fight or a tennis match. A talent competition or a\n                stock-market takeover bid. A battle for market share or the nuclear arms race.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But in this quest for expansion and conquest, the amplified man has acquired weaponry that\n                could well make him and his children the very victims of his ultimate victory. Mutually assured\n                annihilation is the maxim of the nuclear arms race he is engaged in with an opponent who is his\n                equal. And yet, how can one pf them prove their superiority without unleashing this final war?\n                And herein lies the ultimate perversity of his all-pervasive quest for ever greater power.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Return to Life</h4>\n                <p>\n                It is not surprising that the children of the amplified man are getting anxious about survival. They\n                are getting restless because the promised land of automation offers them no role, and little\n                reason for living. They are becoming angry about the blandness of the angular spaces which\n                they are being made to inhabit. They are getting suspicious of the electronic conjuring tricks of\n                advertising, the mirage of fast cars and super clothes which they cannot afford to buy. They do\n                not accept their own redundancy, or the redundancy of life on earth.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The amplified man has implanted himself in all of us to some extent, but we are increasingly in\n                conflict within ourselves. We are tempted by the comforts and power we are offered, and yet we\n                are appalled by the ruthlessness of attempts for our whole being to be taken over. And whilst we\n                are creatures of our time, we will not accept that time is going to run out on us.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The amplified man calls his children darlings one moment and hooligans with the next breath.\n                Because he can't seem to love, he distracts them with an ever-greater array of gadgets, and as\n                they grow up, he finds ever newer ways of grafting them onto his machines. But his children are\n                getting restless, and many now refuse to participate in his games, seeking fulfilment in human\n                relationships instead. They have started to listen to people who have not forgotten their\n                'primitive' humanity. They want to learn from people who still know how to listen to their heart,\n                who still know how to use their hands to make things, and still use their feet for walking.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Many young people have rediscovered the value and beauty of life, and have adopted life itself\n                as a revered teacher. They are sickened by the onslaught on nature in the name of economic\n                and technological progress, and they don't want any part in the life-denying wargames of the\n                amplified man. They will not be subservient to the infernal machines that he is using to conquer\n                life. And they will not tolerate the isolation that results from unbridled mechanisation.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                People’s yearning for a meaningful and non-destructive life is becoming a major challenge to\n                the amplified man. Many of us would rather be ‘old-fashioned’ centaurs or fauns or mermaids,\n                humans fused with animal beings, rather than being grafted onto machines in the image of the\n                amplified man. This refusal to cooperate with him and his schemes coincides with the deep\n                yearning for cooperation with each other, living in a society in which mutual aid and love and\n                respect for other beings becomes essential to our behaviour.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                By any standards, our impacts on our home planet are utterly disproportionate to our physical\n                size, and even our numbers. Since to some degree we are all part of the onslaught on it, it is up\n                at us all to do something about it. Can the David within us have a word with the Goliath that\n                resides in us all and tell him that things can't go on the way they have done in recent years and\n                decades? Human destiny is not for sale to the highest bidder, regardless as to what he intends\n                to do with it. And neither is the destiny of the planet. If Goliath refuses to listen, must David pick\n                up the stone and throw it at him?

Main-streaming renewables is a historic opportunity for putting\n                        manufacturing, transport and the built environment on a sustainable energy footing.</p>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h4>Towards carbon positive living</h4>\n                        <p>The climate crisis has induced a profound sense of insecurity in millions.

Furthermore, global relations are still marred by\n                        extreme divergence between rich and poor.

In the Amazon, I saw huge areas\n                of tropical forest incinerated and converted into cattle ranches. I encountered armies of\n                displaced people digging up bauxite, tin and gold in mines deep in the forest. I saw huge\n                stacks of mahogany cut from virgin rainforests. Piled up in ports like Belem, where were all\n                these 'goods' going? Crates were stamped with the legends 'London', 'Paris' and those of\n                other leading European cities.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cities consume the bulk of the world's output. Look at Paris, a great and beautiful city, but,\n                like its siblings and rivals, it is a vast transformer of resources gleaned from across the globe\n                to be processed into consumer products and services, forever finding new ways of\n                stimulating appetites, whether in terms of stylish restaurants or modish art galleries.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the process, Paris and London, driven by consumerism and by an insatiable desire to\n                move onwards and upwards, pile up mountains of rubbish and spew billions of tons of\n                waste gases into the atmosphere. In the summer months they are wrapped in a veil of toxic\n                haze, from power station and factory chimneys, and from the exhausts of cars and lorries on\n                their streets, and on the motorways that link them to a network of lesser and rival cities.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                With half the world's population now urban dwellers, the fate of the environment depends\n                on the future development of the city - the way it functions, the way it is planned and built,\n                the way it relates to the rest of the world. The issue is not to retreat from it, as so many\n                ecologically minded people used to believe, but to change it. Some people see the city as a\n                monster - and it often behaves like one - but it is here to stay.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cities, whatever their faults, are stimulating: places of a rich cultural mix, and of political and\n                social freedoms. When I first arrived in London in the early Sixties I was astounded to meet\n                people from all parts of the world in one place. Yes, there were tensions, even riots, yet in\n                Notting Hill, where I settled and helped to run the first carnivals, a new global culture was in\n                the making.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Unlike many of my friends at that time, I did not travel to the corners of the earth for new\n                experiences. I did not need to. I was intrigued just listening to the stories of people newly\n                settled in London: tales from Nigeria, Sri Lanka and India. The city appeared to be giving\n                something back to some of the peoples from whose places it had drawn its resources from.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We need to assess our cities not only by their cultural output, but also by the implications\n                they have for the environment. We need a clearer understanding of how to reduce their\n                dependence on global resources.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Cities will always be centres of trade, but how can that trade be conducted within the\n                framework of sustainability? The onus on us now is to make the city work responsibly, so\n                that what it consumes in terms of energy and resources, it gives back in ecological terms: we\n                need to audit the city.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Urban people - citizens - with their command of the world's resources, are particularly well\n                placed to assess their impact on the biosphere. Will they take responsibility for the global\n                impact of their culturally rich lifestyles? Can they initiate an urban ecological culture?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                It is here that planners, architects and urban authorities have a crucial new role. There is\n                now plenty of evidence that cities can dramatically improve their environmental\n                performance. The starting point is an analysis of the urban metabolism, with its input of raw\n                materials and output of wastes. Can we account for the full environmental impact of cities?\n                Can we change and redesign the way they work?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Economists have recently developed new tools for environmental accountancy. One of\n                these is quantifying the role of cities in the context of 'GND' - annual 'gross national\n                damage'. In Germany, GND has been assessed at some 6 per cent of GNP, or around DM 100\n                bn (£ 42 bn) a year. This includes damage to national forests caused by air pollution, ground\n                water contamination, soil degradation and corrosion damage to buildings. Much of this is\n                due to the waste discharges of cities. Using such analytical tools, substantial efforts are now\n                being made to move towards greater urban sustainability.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Take energy. In Holland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, 200 cities and towns have\n                formed a 'Climate Alliance', committed to reducing their fossil fuel consumption by 50 per\n                cent by the year 2010. This exceeds by far the commitments towards greater energy\n                efficiency made by their governments. Such a dramatic commitment to urban energy\n                conservation requires a major rethink of our approaches to both energy supply and energy\n                consumption, involving engineers, architects, transport planners, as well as householders.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                London, with 7 million people in 1993, needs the energy equivalent of a supertanker full of\n                oil twice a week, year-in, year-out. At the other end of the equation, it blows some 180,000\n                tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every day. Only a dramatic increase in energy\n                efficiency of its buildings and transport systems, and the supply of energy from renewable\n                resources such as the widespread use of solar energy and wind power, could help to make\n                London's energy supply sustainable in the medium term. A study in Berlin, with a similar\n                climate, has shown that 30 per cent of its current electricity consumption could be supplied\n                from the solar-panels installed on the city’s roofs.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beyond the issue of energy, it is the broader understanding of the functioning of cities that\n                is of key importance. Modern cities are the home of the 'amplified man', in whom biology\n                and technology merge almost indistinguishably. We are both man and machine, apparently\n                unable to function without motors or wheels. Our biological requirements - food, water, air\n                - and technological ones – lorries, cars, washing machines, hi-fis - all have their own\n                environmental implications. Food wastes, aluminium cans, glass bottles and plastic bags are\n                all mixed in one unmanageable, sticky mess, and to disentangle this is a massive\n                undertaking.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Other European capitals, such as Rome and Madrid, have developed much clearer\n                perspectives of the alternatives. Rome has now achieved virtually total recycling of its\n                wastes. The British government's obsession with deregulating the infrastructure of our cities\n                is ecologically damaging, because it undermines concerted city-wide efforts to tackle a\n                problem that spreads from Piccadilly Circus to the heart of the Amazon. Only concerted\n                action, democratically organised, can make sense.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Architecture, too, has a major role to play in reducing the environmental impact of cities.\n                Architects may have to re-examine their role in the urban scene. Their cherished concept of\n                building monuments of wilful inventiveness may have to give way to design in the service of\n                ecological sustainability.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Ecological design means minimising the environmental impact of buildings during use. They\n                can be made to run on a minimum of heating or cooling, whatever the prevailing climate.\n                Low-conductivity building materials, super insulation, the use of solar energy, hi-tech metal-\n                coated glass and high-efficiency lighting systems are available for all buildings, new and\n                existing. Who will make these the standard requirements for contemporary architecture?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                None of these requirements means that we need turn the clock back in terms of design. An\n                ecologically sound building does not have to look tweedy, or borrow its form from past\n                styles. Architects like Norman Foster or Richard Rogers are working at the cutting edge of\n                ecologically responsible design as they conceptualise sophisticated new buildings for the\n                turn of the century. Many of the most interesting ecologically responsible buildings in recent\n                years have come from architects and engineers working at the leading-edge of engineering\n                and technology. By comparison, many of London's old buildings are very unsound from an\n                ecological point of view; poorly insulated, they waste energy.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                However, to make our cities sustainable in the long term requires much more than\n                improvements to the environmental performance of buildings. Culturally we need to\n                develop a new concept of the city: The urban mind map can no longer stop at the city limits.\n                The tentacles of our cities stretch around the globe.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Understanding this may change the way we view our cities, as places where culture is as\n                much about the ecological implications of city living as about art and architecture, theatre\n                and music, food and recreation. Cities are here to stay, but we should assure that they\n                function efficiently without further damaging the earth’s ecosystems: Paris, London and\n                Frankfurt in balance with the Amazon.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Gaia","import React from 'react';\nimport './Earthrise.scss';\n\nclass Earthrise extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"earthRise\">\n                <div className=\"earthriseBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Earthrise</h3>\n                <h4>From the 4 th chapter of my book ‘Earthrise’, Paladin, 1992</h4>\n                <p>It was 7 September 1988. Brasilia was celebrating Independence Day. Hundreds of\n                thousands of people were lined up along the central boulevard, Avenida Luis Vargas: black,\n                brown and white, shoeshine boys, office clerks, government officials and street vendors. On\n                their separate stand, away from the crowds, stood army officers, decorated for wars they\n                had never fought. The president himself in his ceremonial uniform saluted his troops. Brass\n                bands were playing rousing music as tanks and armoured vehicles rumbled by on the\n                asphalt and fighter planes and helicopters flew in formation overhead, releasing multi-\n                coloured smoke. There was a carnival atmosphere as the people, once again, celebrated\n                Brazil's independence from the country's former colonial masters, the Portuguese. Small\n                children, sitting on their fathers' shoulders, were waving green and yellow paper flags with\n                one hand and eating pink ice cream with the other under the burning sun.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But, meanwhile, so I had been told, the people in the Amazon were celebrating\n                Independence Day in a rather different manner. I wanted to find out how. I was on my way\n                to the Amazon to film a Channel 4 documentary called ‘Jungle Pharmacy.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Early the next morning, I clambered into a Brazilian-made Bandeirante passenger plane to\n                fly to the interior. As soon as the small two-engine plane climbed into the sky the air around\n                us was hazy. There was a veil of smoke between ourselves and the dry land below, which\n                was the cerrado, the savannah country in the heart of Brazil where emus had roamed for\n                time immemorial. Every so often it was criss-crossed by a small river. Strange green circles\n                were dotted across the landscape. They were irrigated fields of soya beans and sugar cane,\n                my neighbour told me; the land of the emus was becoming farming country.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A steward emerged from the cockpit and offered us little plastic cups of sweet coffee,\n                cafezinho. He climbed across boxes and baby cots that protruded into the gangway. In\n                addition to the coffee he also passed around feather headdresses and other tokens of\n                indigenous culture for us to buy as souvenirs. The fifteen passengers were an intriguing\n                assortment of nursing mothers, beefy timber merchants, adventurer types and journalists.\n                We communicated as best we could against the drone of the engines of the unpressurized\n                plane. Most people spent their time reading spy novels or sleeping, but I was horribly\n                fascinated by the scene below.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The landscape had changed from cerrado to tropical forest. Great columns of smoke were\n                rising into the sky right across the land, from horizon to horizon. Large areas of forest down\n                there belonged to cattle ranchers now, and the new owners had celebrated yesterday's\n                Independence Day by setting patches of it alight; the 7 th September had been designated as\n                the day for the start of the queimadas, the Amazon forest fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From the plane some large fires were now clearly visible, but as we flew deeper into the\n                interior, the yellow smoke lay thick as a London smog below us. We could no longer see the\n                land, only the contours of hills rose up through the thick blanket from time to time. My\n                neighbour told me that people were clearing land for cattle, for coffee, for sugar cane and\n                for soybeans. Brazil needs to develop, he said, forests are in the way. The sooner they are\n                gone, the better. Isn't that what you did in Europe, in America? Isn't that the way to make a\n                civilization?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After three hours in the air, it was time to land at our first stop-over, some nameless small\n                town carved out of the jungle by loggers, cattle ranchers and gold-diggers. As we made our\n                descent we could see nothing but smoke until we neared the ground. As we landed, there\n                trees were burning like giant torches right next to the dirt airstrip. They looked as though\n                they had been set ablaze just to mark the runway. It was a crazy, sickening sight.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Back in the air on our way to Redencao I could not believe the scale of what was happening\n                below us. The forests were burning everywhere. The smoke became so thick it penetrated\n                even the cabin of the plane. Some of the passengers started coughing and there were tears\n                running down their cheeks, their eyes burning with the acrid smoke. These were not tears of\n                anger about such immeasurable destruction of the forest below us; most people did not\n                seem overly concerned, except when one of the babies almost seemed to choke. The pilot\n                climbed as high as he could, given the plane's lack of a pressure cabin, up and away from the\n                smoke. I tried to read a book but I could not concentrate. It was a truly nightmarish scene.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After another couple of hours, it was time to land again. The plane took another dive down\n                through the smoke, down into the burning forest to unload men and boxes at a frontier\n                town called Conceiccao do Araguaia. What was their business here? Were they cattle\n                ranchers who had ordered their men to set even more of the forest ablaze? Were they on\n                their way to stake out a mining claim?\n                <br></br>\n                One more take-off and we were on our way to our final destination, Redencao, another\n                hour's flight. The smoke was thicker than ever and I went into the cockpit to ask the pilot\n                whether he'd seen it as bad as this before. He stared at the inquisitive foreigner, but was\n                polite and helpful, nevertheless. Yes, he said, he had, but not for hour after hour like today.\n                He still remembered when this was just a sea of green, with only the occasional Indian\n                village in a jungle clearing. But the Amazon was changing. We had taken seven hours to get\n                here, including our time on the ground. The air had been thick with smoke all the way. No, it\n                wasn't fun flying in the Amazon these days, he said. It was getting too dangerous, there was\n                too much smoke. Too many people were burning too much forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The pilot excused himself. After all, he had a plane to fly. And now he was diving down\n                through the smoke once more on our approach to the airstrip at Redencao. But there was a\n                problem – he could not find it in the smoky air. He circled and crossed through it and back,\n                flying as low as he could, but there was no airstrip in sight, only burning trees and land on\n                fire. This was truly a nightmare landscape, an inferno of unbelievable proportions. Anger\n                was welling up inside me such as I had never felt before. We were witnessing an ecological\n                holocaust, right there a few hundred feet below us, and what could we do about it, except\n                observe it, take pictures of it and try to tell the world? The Earth's greatest storehouse of\n                plants and animals was being incinerated as though it was no more than a pile of dry logs.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Later, I was to learn that in those few weeks of September 1988 some fifty million acres of\n                forest and grassland were on fire, some 10 per cent of Brazil's Amazon region. Back in\n                London I phoned an American astronaut, Dick Covey, who had been circling the Earth in the\n                American space shuttle during those days. He told me that the whole of South America was\n                covered by a blanket of smoke. Nobody, no pilot, no astronaut, nobody in the world had\n                ever seen anything like it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At last our pilot found the airstrip. We dived through the smoke to a nerve-racking but\n                perfect landing. We had arrived. As I drove through Redencao, the town was so thick with\n                smoke that the taxi driver had to put the headlights on, even though it was early afternoon.\n                There was a concert of car horns in the streets of this Wild West town as drivers made sure\n                to avoid each other. They were driving through this infernal landscape as if blindfolded.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The other members of the film crew were waiting in a small hotel. They had gone ahead in\n                another plane. For hours we talked about nothing but the gigantic fires and the smoke-filled\n                landscape. We had intentionally come here at the time of the queimadas, but what we were\n                seeing was obscene beyond imagining.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Redencao was a frontier town straight out of a Wild West movie, Brazilian style. Most of the\n                houses were nailed together from wooden planks. Only in the centre were there stores,\n                bars and large villas that had a sense of concrete permanence about them. The people\n                walking the streets did not give the impression that they were perturbed by the smoke.\n                Even the few Indians we met seemed unconcerned, going about their normal business.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Next day, as we drove out of Redencao, we could see the transformation the Amazon\n                landscape was going through, a transformation quite deliberately planned by the Brazilian\n                generals over twenty years previously. Wherever the road led, trees were being cleared on\n                both sides. There was smouldering forest everywhere, stumps of trees grotesquely\n                projecting up out of the ash-covered soil.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some standing trees were still burning, with flames shooting out of the branches high up in\n                the sky. An eerie silence was interrupted only by the sound of explosions, as pockets of air\n                expanded and tree trunks burst. Here and there cattle with humps were wandering about\n                aimlessly in the blackened landscape, looking for grass. The fence posts on their pasture had\n                burned down and they had escaped, clearly bewildered by the fires and the smoke. One was\n                limping badly, her hoof apparently singed. Up in the sky, groups of screeching parrots were\n                flying about where only a couple of days ago there had been the crowns of trees, fruit trees,\n                nesting trees. But they were gone, reduced to ashen traces on the smouldering soil.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And all of this devastation had been wreaked in the name of development. 'Land for people\n                for people without land', that was the government slogan that started it all. But there was\n                not much evidence of peasants and small farms. The last great untouched forest region on\n                earth was being turned into a giant cattle ranch. Never mind that the thin soil was not really\n                suitable for grass. And never mind that the land, when it was still forest, had actually been\n                inhabited by people, other people, forest people who had been living here for tens of\n                thousands of years. Oh, but they were 'primitive' people, weren't they? They were not\n                worthy of survival in a new world of chain saws and sawmills, refrigerated trucks and\n                hydroelectric dams.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Out of the smoke a small town emerged, made up only of huts nailed together from\n                mahogany planks, one of hundreds like it across Amazonia. Gold had been found and people\n                had flocked in from far and wide. They were mostly men, mostly young men with haggard\n                faces looking with suspicion as the minibus full of gringos stopped outside a bar. What were\n                we doing here, anyway? Inside, beer sold at two dollars a bottle and plenty of it was being\n                drunk. A few of the men had mouths full of gold teeth, and fat bellies. They were drinking\n                spirits, and looked at us even more suspiciously than the rest. One of them pulled a handful\n                of small nuggets out of his pocket. Did we want to buy some gold? No thanks, we are only\n                passing through.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The road was full of deep holes and the suspension of the minibus was less than adequate,\n                not to mention the steering. The driver proceeded, nevertheless, as though he were on a\n                racetrack and we held our breath each time we crossed one of those narrow tree-trunk\n                bridges. In several places, smouldering forest giants were lying across the dirt road and we\n                had to screech to a halt. Since it was impossible to move them and as we had no time to\n                wait until they had turned into ash, we were forced to cut holes in the cattle fence with wire\n                cutters, and to drive over the ash-filled pasture until the dirt road was passable again.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Suddenly there was a chain across the road and a sign announcing the Gorotire Indian\n                Reserve. A man came out of his hut, an Amerindian with long black hair. He was wearing\n                shorts and a T-shirt like the Indians we had seen in Redencao. He was on guard duty. After\n                we had explained that we had come to film with the Kayapo, he went back to the hut to\n                consult with another man. Then he dropped the chain and let us through.\n                The road narrowed and became more winding. Soon we realized we had come to a different\n                world. Here, for the first time on our journey, we saw the colour green. There were tall trees\n                and it was shady and quite cool. Trees covered in vines, orchids and all kinds of epiphytes\n                rose up on both sides of the track. No two trees seemed alike. Birds were singing and flying\n                about, howler monkeys were shouting at us. There was still smoke in the air, but for the first\n                time for hours there were no fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Gorotire is a village made up of modern brick houses. It was not arranged in a circle like\n                traditional Indian villages, but had been built along a central track. The Kayapo in Gorotire\n                live in a world somewhere between ancient and modern. They still wear feather head-\n                dresses, but they also wear white man's clothes. They still paint their faces and bodies, but\n                their brightly coloured glass beads are imported from Czechoslovakia.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Kayapo greeted us with generous smiles. I had met some of them in Brasilia. The three\n                Gorotire chiefs, Kanhok, Ute and Totoi, and some of the village warriors had been active in\n                the campaign for proper constitutional rights for all Indians. They had stayed in a mission\n                school in the capital and had been driven to the House of Parliament every day to\n                participate at a convention to draw up a new constitution for the country. They had even\n                led lobby discussions, determined at long last to be granted full rights of citizenship in their\n                own country. They had done so in their unique style, chanting and dancing outside\n                parliament clad in their jungle best, their heads dressed in multi-coloured parrot feathers.\n                They had looked magnificent in the air-conditioned lobby of the Hilton Hotel, in a world\n                usually inhabited only by men in grey lightweight suits.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Now, in Gorotire, they greeted us with great warmth. They had been expecting us. We were\n                invited to the men's house and I was given a chance to explain the purpose of our visit to\n                everybody. The documentary we were making was concerned with the Indians' knowledge\n                of the forest and its medicinal plants. Our purpose was to ascertain whether the Indians\n                really were the great experts in forest ecology and in medicinal plant remedies they were\n                reputed to be by some anthropologists.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup, the shaman we had come to film with, did not live in one pf the modern houses.\n                He preferred a traditional straw and mud hut away from the centre of the village. He\n                welcomed us with the detached curiosity of an old man who had seen many changes in his\n                life. He had the silver-haired looks of a Harvard professor, but he also wore large hoops of\n                glass beads in his ears.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The evening was for dancing and celebrations in which the whole village took part. We were\n                fed a delicious meal consisting of fish, bananas and manioc, steamed in banana leaves. But\n                somehow we were not in a party mood after seeing all those fires: they had reached to\n                within fifteen miles of Gorotire.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The next morning, we got our equipment ready to film with Beptopup, who had said he\n                would take us take us downriver into the forest to show us his medicinal plant garden. Dr\n                Elaine Elisabetsky, director of the school of ethno-pharmacology at Belem University, had\n                visited Beptopup many times before to learn about his use of forest plants. She brought\n                Beptopup and his granddaughter down to the boat. For half an hour we canoed down the\n                Fresco River along banks covered with tall trees. The water was not crystal-clear, as one\n                would expect, but brown with soil from a nearby gold mine. After half an hour in the canoe,\n                we stopped at a small landing stage.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                We followed Beptopup along a narrow forest path. He walked like a young man as he\n                ducked below branches, picking the leaves of plants and wild passion fruit dangling off the\n                trees. The forest interior was full of the sorts of plants that decorate living rooms back home\n                in London or New York: cheese plants, wild pineapple, heliconias, all kinds of orchids, plants\n                with beautifully coloured leaves, and what we call ‘rubber plants’. They are at home in the\n                moist shade of the forest, which has a constant temperature of some twenty-six degrees\n                centigrade all the year round. The forest is surprisingly cool, but once it is removed, the\n                daytime temperature shoots up to thirty-five or forty degrees under the fierce tropical sun.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup was in the world he had always known, the forest world of his ancestors. It just\n                happened to be one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. But as anthropologists had\n                established, he and his people knew virtually every living thing in their familiar world. In\n                fact, ehnobiologists from European and American universities who had studied his\n                knowledge, and that of other shamans of Amazonian tribes, had found that they had a\n                name for every plant in the forest and a use for most. And why not? The Amerindians have\n                been in the Amazon for tens of thousands of years, plenty of time to experiment with the\n                use of plants for food and medicine.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One does not need scientific instruments to learn about the world; our senses; the capacity\n                of our six senses and the knowledge systems passed on from generation to generation will\n                do. Now, at the very moment that many of the forest tribes had been almost wiped out,\n                people are beginning to realize that these are not 'primitives', but world experts on the\n                fauna and flora of the rainforest who have a great deal to teach humanity if we want to\n                utilize the biological resources of the living forest intelligently.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup understood that we had not come with chain saws and bulldozers like white men\n                usually do, but that our film camera was there to record his forest science and to show the\n                world how his knowledge was profoundly relevant to humanity. Many plants have medicinal\n                uses yet to be explored by modern science. We had not come to tell him and his people\n                what to do, but to listen and to learn. Beptopup's profound familiarity with the world\n                around him was amply illustrated as we walked along together through the green shade of\n                the forest. He unselfconsciously spoke with his granddaughter, Bekwaiti, quietly touching\n                and teaching her the names of plants we encountered on our way deeper and deeper into\n                the jungle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                After an hour's walk we reached his forest garden. American ethnobiologist Dr Darrell\n                Posey, who spent much time in Gorotire, had told us that it was here that Beptopup had\n                lived for many years of his life with his wife and children away from the village. In the 1960s\n                his fellow tribesmen had threatened to kill him because he could not come up with\n                medicines against the new diseases the white men had brought to the village and which\n                were decimating the Kayapo. He, the shaman and medicine man, was expected to know\n                how to cure all diseases known to them, but now he had no medicines against new diseases\n                like flu, meningitis, TB, whooping cough, measles, polio and virulent strains of malaria. It had\n                all happened so suddenly and there was no time to experiment with forest medicines.\n                Beptopup decided to escape from the anger of his people and to live away from the village.\n                And so he packed his bags and hammock, and he and his wife and children moved away ·\n                deep into the forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some seven years later, he left his forest garden and went back to the village so that his\n                children could be named in the proper ceremony. The tribe welcomed him back because he\n                knew plant remedies that would stop the women from having babies. Many women did not\n                want babies any longer, they said, because the white man was taking the land away from\n                them. They did not want to live in a world without forests, without shade, without birds and\n                monkeys. Could he come and administer the contraceptive remedies?\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And Beptopup stayed in the village and gave the women the seeds of a particular orchid,\n                and a brew made from the bark of a special tree, and for many years few babies were born\n                in the village. Cattle ranchers burned more and more of the forest nearby and gold-diggers\n                came and carved deep holes in the ground and dumped sludge full of mercury in the Fresco\n                River. The fish were poisoned and people became ill from swimming in the muddy water.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But the Kayapo, unlike other tribes in the Amazon, were warriors. One day they decided\n                they were no longer going to be messed around, that they would rather die than lose their\n                forests and their dignity. After years of suffering, they took their destiny in their own hands.\n                They brought warriors together from several other villages and one day in 1985 they\n                stormed the gold miners' camp. With war clubs and spears and a few guns they drove the\n                miners into a large shed and locked the doors. They then radioed the Brazilian government\n                and insisted on having their land demarcated before they would release the miners. And\n                they wanted it – now!\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                And that is what actually happened: within a few days the Brazilian government, after years\n                of inaction, flew in land surveyors and actually demarcated the Gorotire reserve. The\n                Kayapo chiefs negotiated for a share of the gold mine, since they knew they could not get\n                rid of it. After contracts were formally signed, the miners were released by the warriors,\n                who went back to their villages. For the first time in years the Kayapo had some control over\n                their own destiny and could be more optimistic about the future. Today there are many\n                children again in Gorotire. And at night around the camp fires, they are often told the\n                stories of the great victory of the Kayapo over the gold miners and the government.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Beptopup's forest garden was an outcrop of granite rocks several hundred metres across. In\n                the cracks between the rocks, soil had accumulated and this is where he had planted his\n                medicinal plants, remedies his people had used successfully for millennia. He proudly\n                showed us several specimens of an orchid that he had planted (its botanical name\n                Epistephium lucidum), whose seeds he used as the contraceptive he had administered to\n                the women. He insisted: 'Women who take this will have no more babies, no more babies at\n                all. It dries up their wombs, it dries them up completely.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The use of the seeds of this particular orchid as a contraceptive has been confirmed by\n                several anthropologists and one missionary who worked with the Kayapo, though their\n                contraceptive action had not yet been tested scientifically. But weeks after we left Brazil, at\n                the pharmacology institute of the University of Chicago, we were able to film a research\n                student, Karen Lowell, who was testing another contraceptive remedy which Peruvian and\n                Ecuadorian Indians call piri-piri. The grass-like plant had turned out to have a definitive\n                contraceptive effect in trials with laboratory mice. Research into this and other Amazonian\n                contraceptive remedies continues. Meanwhile pharmaceutical institutes and companies\n                across the world are screening thousands of tropical forest plants every year for their\n                medicinal efficacy.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Knowledge of plant medicines used by Amerindians is passed on verbally from generation to\n                generation. Tribal people like the Kayapo know that it is the old people who are the best\n                teachers for the young. All children learn some of the ancient plant knowledge as they grow\n                up, but only a few, like Beptopup, become specialists whose comprehensive knowledge is\n                greatly cherished. The appearance of the white man and his new diseases and new\n                medicines caused so much confusion and uncertainty. Now, shamans like Beptopup have\n                new pupils: ethnobiologists like Dr Darrell Posey who have made tribal knowledge of plants\n                and animals the focus of their research. He has written more than a hundred scientific\n                papers on the Kayapo knowledge system.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                This is what he told us: 'Beptopup for many years has been my guide and my teacher. The\n                gap between our cultures is very large and he has been very patient with me. I think he is\n                aware of the fact that his is the last generation with that degree of knowledge. I have come\n                to realize that his is a systematic knowledge which has developed for thousands and\n                thousands of years. It is very rich indeed. Yes, it is science, and a very complex one at that. It\n                is, in fact, a testable knowledge. If we find that it works we can integrate it into our own\n                scientific context.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Kayapo, who I have studied with, do have plants for controlling fertility, which as we\n                know is an enormous issue all over the planet. But this also raises an ethical issue: we have\n                to find ways to compensate native peoples for the knowledge of medicinal plants which\n                they are contributing. I don't think that we can ethically exploit this knowledge without\n                proper rewards. If we did that it would be nothing more than a form of neo-colonialism, in\n                which we are taking their science, mass-producing it without giving benefits to the native\n                people who are the guardians of that knowledge.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A couple of days after filming in Beptopup’s forest garden, we flew him and his wife to an\n                area outside the Kayapo reserve which had once been their own territory. Now it was by the\n                side of a road full of timber lorries on the edge of a cattle ranch. But Beptopup still\n                recognized the land he had not been back to for fifty years. There were still patches of forest\n                left and Darrell wanted to show us how its species composition was, partly, the result of\n                human presence. The Indians do not leave stone monuments in areas of forest they once\n                inhabited, they leave a modified composition of trees with more fruit and nut trees than\n                areas of 'natural' forest. Such patches of 'modified' forest are clearly identifiable if one flies\n                over the jungle.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Down on the ground, Beptopup started reminiscing about the Kayapo village that once,\n                many years ago, existed in this part of the forest. He pointed out medicinal plants that the\n                villagers had planted on the edge of the forest and which were still there. He told us that\n                they were remedies for treating boils, coughs, diarrhoea, and fungal skin diseases. Then, as\n                we stopped filming, we noticed that his wife, Kukein-Kudjai, a woman in her late sixties, had\n                vanished. Soon we saw her right at the top of a Bacaba palm tree, where she was harvesting\n                the bunches of fruit, much to the delight of her husband, who then started making a basket\n                from the palm leaves.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Only a few hundred yards further on, we stumbled up on a smouldering stretch of forest\n                that had been set alight the day before. Beptopup walked around among the blackened\n                stumps in anger and bewilderment, shaking his head again and again. Then he said: 'Why\n                must the white man always destroy everything? Why does he never plant anything? The\n                white man doesn't like the forest, but the forest is good, the forest looks after us. Why does\n                the white man burn the forest and destroy the trees? Where are the turtles going to live,\n                and the birds? How are my children going to live? What are they going to eat? Where will\n                they get their medicines from? Why does the white man hate the forest so much? ... I have\n                said all I want to say, I want to leave.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In summer 1989, I was back in the Amazon to film another documentary for Channel 4 in\n                London, ‘Halting the Fires’. This time our purpose was to find out if and how the Amazon\n                forest holocaust might be stopped.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Never before had the assault on rainforests been as fierce as it has been throughout the\n                1980s. In Brazil alone, an area of virgin forest the size of France has been cleared in the the\n                1970s and ‘80s, some 15 per cent of Brazil's Amazon forests. This does not include the huge\n                areas of forest along the Atlantic coast which vanished during the process of Brazil's colonial\n                conquest. Just three per cent of the Atlantic forest remains. The rest has been annihilated\n                and converted to cattle ranches, soybean farms, and coffee and sugar-cane plantations, and\n                for urban development.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The massive eradication, or 'development', of Brazil's Amazon forest in recent years is the\n                result of deliberate government policy, first formulated by the generals who took over in\n                Brasilia in 1965. At the end of 1966, General Castello Branco unveiled his 'Operation\n                Amazonia' strategy with operatic pomp: he invited 300 of his fellow generals, Brazilian and\n                foreign businessmen, industrialists, bankers and planners on board the pleasure cruiser\n                Rosa de Fonseca for a trip from Manaus up the Amazon. The party discussed the\n                ‘modernization’ of the Amazon.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The fiscal instruments for this purpose were to be tax breaks, land concessions, trade\n                incentives and all kinds of special credits for the developers. Cattle ranchers, logging\n                companies and mining corporations soon took advantage of the sweeteners on offer from\n                the Brazilian government. In order to facilitate the 'development', a massive programme of\n                road construction was initiated. Once the bulldozers had cut deep gashes into the jungle,\n                the trees on both sides could be cut or burned down. Once the forest was incinerated, grass\n                seeds were spread into the ash by the same means. Often hundreds or even thousands of\n                acres were ‘developed’ in one fell swoop.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The opening up of the Amazon resulted in an unprecedented boom, with land values as\n                much as doubling every year. Land in the Amazon became a vehicle for capturing incentives\n                and cheap credits, assuming the form of a speculative instrument rather than being an input\n                into agriculture.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ranchers, loggers and mine developers wanted the Amazon for themselves. But a\n                conflict of interests developed between them and poor migrants. An environmental crisis in\n                the north-east of Brazil and the mechanization of agriculture in the south of the country\n                brought about a flood of peasant farmers to the Amazon in search of the promised land,\n                encouraged by the government. They hoped to have their own small farm, a little house\n                surrounded by mango, avocado, coconut and copuacu trees, a few pigs, a chicken and a\n                cow. They wanted a field for growing subsistence crops like rice, corn, beans and manioc\n                and another for cash crops such as cacao, pepper and papaya.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But the power of the big landowners, combined with lack of capital and marketing problems\n                for cash crops, were the downfall of many a small settler. Some were forced to become\n                cowboys on the big facendas. Others were actually employed as pistoleiros, gunslingers, by\n                the big landowners, invading smallholdings in the dead of night, killing settlers or evicting\n                them by threatening murder. Many failed settlers ended up digging for gold at the vast Sera\n                Pelada mine or in thousands of smaller mines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                It has often been said that the soils of the Amazon are not really suitable for farming and\n                that this is the cause of the failure of many settlers. Tropical soils are usually less fertile than\n                the soils of the temperate zones. The main reason is the high metabolic rate of living beings\n                in the moist tropical climate. In the rainforest, most trees drop a few leaves all the year\n                round and as they reach the ground fungi, caterpillars or herbivores munch them up. Leaves\n                are thus quickly converted back into plant food, which is then rapidly absorbed by the soil,\n                to be used by the roots of trees and shrubs for new growth. Trees actually contain much of\n                the fertility present in forests, and a thick layer of leaf mould never accumulates as it does in\n                temperate forests. Thus tropical forest soils converted into farmland are usually deficient in\n                humus, and settlers find it hard to use them for anything other than tree crops.\n                The conversion of tropical forests into pasture is a particularly questionable enterprise. This\n                becomes abundantly clear when one travels across the Amazon on the dirt roads that have\n                been built since the sixties, as I have done for many months. There are now endless\n                stretches of grassland dotted with the burnt-off remains of trees projecting starkly into the\n                sky. Only very occasionally does one see a cow or, even more rarely, a buffalo. Usually the\n                pastures are neatly fenced, but often the fences enclose scrubland which is neither pasture\n                nor forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Half of the pastures established within the last twenty years or so in the Amazon are now\n                abandoned. In fact, many have never actually seen a cow. Frequently, they were simply\n                used by their owners to attract development subsidies and other kinds of financial support\n                from the government. In twenty years from the 1970s onwards, the Brazilian government\n                paid out no less than six billion dollars in such tax incentives to Brazilian landowners, much\n                of it borrowed from foreign banks. In return, Brazil gained a largely unproductive area of so-\n                called 'pastureland' in the Amazon, approximately the size of France. This astonishing waste\n                of resources was for many years a cornerstone of Brazil's development policy. In addition to\n                the devastation of the environment, other sectors of the Brazilian economy were starved of\n                much-needed development capital.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The ruthless and senseless destruction of the Amazon forest throughout the 1970s and\n                1980s could not be kept a secret. Films and reports about the forest holocaust soon led to\n                the formation of pressure groups in Europe and the USA, focusing on the environmental\n                dangers of deforestation in the tropics. Researchers discovered that much of the money\n                spent on 'developing' the region was paid out by the World Bank and other development\n                banks which received their funds from taxpayers in Europe and North America. But few\n                taxpayers were aware how their money was being spent.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Above all, it was road construction which paved the way for cattle ranching as well as\n                mining projects. The BR 364, which was cut from Cuiaba in Mato Grosso through Rondonia\n                towards Rio Branco, capital of Acre, was particularly contentious. The World Bank was\n                forced to reconsider its investment policy when demonstrations in Washington led to\n                enquiries in the US Congress. The bank had actually ignored its own environmentalists, who\n                had warned of the consequences for the virgin forest of the construction of this road. It has\n                since been paved and, although there are already plenty of new potholes, the road is here\n                to stay, facilitating further destruction of the forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Bom Futuro mine in the state of Rondonia is a case in point. A few years ago, rich\n                deposits of tin ore were discovered in this location near Ariquemes on the BR 364. Wildcat\n                miners started prospecting for the ore. The first few arrived on mules, kitted out only with\n                picks, shovels, sacks and rudimentary refining equipment. When the rumour started\n                spreading that there were rich pickings at Bom Futuro (the 'mine of the good future'),\n                thousands followed. A road was bulldozed through the forest. It is a sad irony that the\n                subsequent success of wildcat mines like Bom Futuro made long-established tin mines in\n                places like Cornwall in southern England uncompetitive, forcing them to close.\n                Bom Futuro mine is an astonishing vista. Out of the flowering forest emerges a cratered\n                moon landscape dotted with tents made of black polythene sheets covered in red dust.\n                There are smouldering trees everywhere. Just a few years ago, this was virgin forest. Now\n                25,000 people live here in their makeshift shelters, cutting holes into the ore-rich soil with\n                their pickaxes and shovels. But, increasingly, the operation is being mechanized as the big\n                companies move in. There are any number of Komatsu diggers and Mercedes-Benz lorries,\n                digging up the ore and carting it to processing plants. The miners and truck drivers work\n                around the clock and earn good money by Brazilian standards, but the devastation is\n                appalling and the risks are high.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There are puddles everywhere with swarms of mosquitoes. Just about everybody has\n                malaria. The hospital in Ariquemes is the only one in the world that exclusively treats\n                malaria cases. The hospital director explained why: 'The forest, as an organism, has a\n                defence system. Its defence against devastation are enormous swarms of mosquitoes. We\n                have nearly 300,000 cases of malaria annually. The devastation of the forest should be seen\n                as a political issue.' While we are filming at the hospital, a lorry arrives carrying the corpse of\n                a man who'd been battered to death: a miner who had died in a dispute over mining rights.\n                He was one of about five people killed like that at Bom Futuro every week.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Life in the Amazon comes cheap, for settlers, miners, rubber tappers and Indians alike. In\n                this world of conquest, the original inhabitants are the biggest losers. Road building in their\n                territories invariably results in disease and violent death. Wherever the bulldozers roar\n                through the forests, pushing over trees and levelling hills, Indians are on the retreat. In the\n                past, up to 90 per cent of any given tribe would perish soon after contact. They have no\n                immunity, or indeed traditional medicines, against diseases like measles, TB, whooping\n                cough, polio, meningitis or just the common cold. Until the white man arrived, flu was\n                unknown here. Now it is a killer disease.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Surui chief Itabera told us: 'We never had pneumonia, measles, malaria. When we lived in\n                the jungle we were healthy. After the white man came we started getting sick. One-third of\n                our people have tuberculosis now. That's why we sell our trees to the sawmiller. But he\n                doesn't value us. He just exploits us and our forests.' The same story is told by Indians\n                throughout the Amazon. And where the Indians have not died from disease, many have died\n                from bullets.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In another Amazon state, Para, we went to film the new town of Paragominas. It is located\n                on another new road, the Brasilia-Belem highway. This place has been called the 'sawmill\n                capital of the world'. There are some 500 mills, financed mainly with government grants.\n                They slice up the thousands of trees brought every day along the web of dirt roads cut into\n                the forests. A permanent smoke cloud hangs over the town from sawdust incinerators and\n                charcoal kilns. Over forty species of trees are processed in the sawmills. As they are cut\n                down in the forest, they tear down many other trees with them, because they are\n                connected by a tangle of lianas. The degraded forest dries out much more than virgin forest,\n                with the big trees no longer providing shade. Such forests are an easy prey for fires.\n                Apart from providing high-quality timber cheaply, places like Paragominas also produce\n                charcoal, the new boom industry in the Amazon. It is the sawmill off-cuts that are stacked\n                into the charcoal kilns. The kilns are worked by resettlers from other parts of Brazil. Men\n                and women earn around ten dollars a week, but the majority of the workforce are children.\n                They earn little more than food money. One boy told us: 'I get up at one o'clock in the\n                morning to work the whole day. We have no school, no nothing. We only suffer and work\n                here. The charcoal won't let the children grow. We work and work but we hardly make any\n                money.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Charcoal kilns are proliferating in Amazonia, not just ones burning sawmill off-cuts. In the\n                south of Para, around Maraba, the virgin forest is being cut down to be converted directly\n                into charcoal, thousands of acres every year. Some of the charcoal is used for grilling steaks,\n                but most of it is actually used for smelting pig iron.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Grand Carajas project in Para is the largest iron-ore mine in the world. Brazil has run up\n                a world-record debt – some 120 billion dollars – to set up new industries and new mining\n                operations such as the Carajas mine. It is the richest source of iron ore in the world.\n                Financed by loans from the EU, Japan and the USA, it provides the raw material for steel\n                industries throughout the Western world. Our cars, fridges, washing machines, pipelines\n                and iron girders are now made mostly from ore mined in Carajas, a mountain of iron first\n                discovered when the compasses of planes flying over it went wild.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Brazil's state-owned mining company, Compania do Vale de Rio Doce, developed Carajas\n                into a super-efficient operation. With giant diggers and 180-ton trucks imported from the\n                USA the company is trying to make large profits and to earn hard currency for Brazil. Carajas\n                is the name of the tribe that once lived here, but its remnants have since been settled\n                elsewhere. The naked 'savages' with their bows and arrows were no match for men\n                equipped with guns and giant machines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In order to transport the ore and the pig iron from The Carajas mine, a 200-mile railway line\n                was specially built to the Atlantic harbour of Sao Luis. The actual mine itself is not an\n                ecological disaster area. In fact, the forests around the Carajas mine have been kept\n                relatively intact. But several pig-iron smelters have now been established around the town\n                of Maraba to the west and it is here that the forests are being incinerated. The trees burned\n                in the kilns come into the equation at zero value, a tempting prospect. And thus the world's\n                most unique flora is turned into profane charcoal to smelt iron ore. Brazil has been using\n                money borrowed from our banks to destroy what is, arguably, its most precious natural\n                asset, the Amazon forest, as though it were absolutely valueless. Thus rainforest trees end\n                up providing us with our cars and washing machines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Para is the easternmost state of the Brazilian Amazon. Apart from Rondonia, it is the most\n                ravaged part of the Amazon forest. It is here that cattle ranching first started. And it is here\n                that the largest mining operations are in place, not just for iron ore, but also for bauxite,\n                manganese, copper and gold. It is in Para that huge areas of forest have been flooded by\n                hydroelectric schemes, largest of all the Tucurui dam which powers Carajas and other\n                mining operations. But it is also here that the resistance against further rainforest\n                destruction has been fiercest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                A new alliance between scientists, ecological activists and Indians has been forged with the\n                purpose of slowing down and ending the destruction. It was a Brazilian professor, Dr Salati,\n                who first pronounced that the continuing destruction of the eastern section of the Amazon\n                forest could have the most severe climatic consequences. He showed that the rains that\n                come in from the Atlantic first shed their moisture over the forests of Para. This rain is\n                absorbed by the trees, but most of it is released again by evapo-transpiration powered by\n                the hot tropical sun. The moisture rises from the steaming forests and blows westwards,\n                where the clouds shed their load again and again. And so the process is repeated six or\n                seven times until the clouds reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, where they are driven\n                upwards by the cold mountain air. Some of them drift southwards, eventually to fall as rain\n                over Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and even as far away as Europe. Others are blown\n                northwards, to reach as far as Mexico and the wheat belts of the USA and Canada.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Scientists have expressed the fear that further deforestation of Para on the eastern rim of\n                the Amazon forest would be disastrous. Already, there are signs that the rains are falling\n                more erratically and that the dry season is getting longer. The local climate seems to be\n                getting drier; the majestic Amazon clouds appear to be drifting by more and more often\n                without shedding their rain. With ever more deforestation, average soil temperatures are\n                rising as they have done elsewhere on the planet where trees have been cut down on a\n                huge scale, as in Africa and India. At the same time, soil moisture is declining and when the\n                rains do pour down there is much more rapid run-off than from land covered by the multi-\n                layered canopy of trees. In deforested regions, soil erosion is severe, washing precious\n                topsoil into the rivers and polluting waters that once teemed with fish.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Dr James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia theory, is convinced of the critical importance\n                of the Amazon forest for sustaining the beneficial interaction between the biosphere and\n                the atmosphere. He recently estimated the cash value of the environmental services of the\n                Amazon to the planet. He likens the forest to a giant air-conditioner, helping to keep the\n                Earth cool and moist. In a recent lecture he stated:\n                <br></br>\n                ‘One way to value the forest as an air-conditioner would be to assess the annual energy cost\n                of achieving the same amount of cooling mechanically. If the clouds made by the forests\n                reduce the heat flux of sunlight received within their canopies, by only 1 per cent, then their\n                cooling effect would require a refrigerator with a cooling power of fourteen kilowatts per\n                acre. The energy needed, assuming complete efficiency and no capital outlay, would cost\n                annually £2,000 per acre ... On this basis, an accurate but imprecise estimate of the worth of\n                the refrigeration system that is the whole of Amazonia is about £100 trillion.’\n                <br></br>\n                The meat yield of an acre of cleared forest temporarily converted into pasture land, by\n                comparison, is equivalent to about 750 hamburgers annually, for which the rancher is paid\n                about £IO.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The indigenous people of the Amazon have not been slow to respond to the realization by\n                ecologists and climatologists that the maintenance of their traditional way of life had a\n                respect, even a reverence, for the forest, would be a good prospect for the world. The most\n                astonishing manifestation of this new allegiance was an extraordinary gathering at the small\n                town of Altamira in the state of Para. It was here that yet another massive hydroelectric\n                dam had reached the planning stage. The dam would have flooded land traditionally\n                inhabited by the Kayapo, the Arara, the Assurini and several other Amerindian tribes. And it\n                was here that the young Kayapo chief Paulinho Payakan decided to hold a very special\n                meeting in February of 1989.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                I had the opportunity to make a short news film about the Altamira gathering for Channel 4,\n                and so to witness what turned out to be an extraordinary event.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                From all parts of the Amazon and from North America, 900 Amerindians arrived. And from\n                Europe, the USA and Brazil, 400 journalists and environmentalists, turned up. The whites\n                came with cameras, tape recorders and word processors. The Indians came with bows and\n                arrows, with wooden clubs, colourful head-dresses, and a few brought their own video\n                cameras.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The only topic on the agenda of the meeting was the future of the rainforest. The forest\n                Indians, threatened with the total destruction of their familiar habitat, had decided to take\n                the future in their own hands.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Never had there been such an extraordinary gathering of Brazilian tribes. The Arara,\n                Xavante, Gaviao, Yanomami, Suya, Guarani, Surui, Parakana and many other tribes sent\n                representatives. They came in buses, by plane and by boat up the Xingu River, all made up in\n                their own distinctive feather head-dresses and body paints. As they arrived, they chanted\n                their tribal songs and war cries. And the inhabitants of Altamira looked on in astonishment -\n                'Watch out, the Indians are coming.' It was like a scene out of a Wild West movie, except it\n                was real.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The meeting was opened by Paulinho Payakan in Altamira's crowded basketball hall. This\n                young Kayapo chief had had the idea of holding the gathering. He and his helpers had\n                organized it with extraordinary vigour and skill. He spoke into the microphone: 'Until\n                recently, we didn't have much reason to believe that the white man would ever understand\n                the Indians, our ways of thinking and living. But now we see groups of lndians and white\n                people working together to save the Amazon forest.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the hall, Kayapo and Xavante warriors displayed their colourful presence, in head-dresses\n                made from parrot feathers. They chanted in support of their chiefs, who gave sad and\n                rousing speeches about decades of death, defending the right of the Indians to live in their\n                own way in the forest, looking after it rather than destroying it. They booed the director of\n                Electronorte, the electricity company that wanted to flood the forests around Altamira with\n                a series of hydroelectric reservoirs the size of Belgium.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Some speakers from the ecology movement pointed out that the Amazon forest contains\n                the greatest variety of plants, animals and insects anywhere on Earth. Many even today had\n                only Indian names.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Others, such as Brazilian ecologist Dr Jose Lutzenberger, were more concerned about the\n                effects of large-scale deforestation on the climate: 'We destroy the trees at our peril. Where\n                the forest disappears and scrub or naked soil takes its place, evapo-transpiration is replaced\n                by hot updraughts that dissolve incoming clouds. If the present rate of deforestation\n                continues in the east, in the states of Para and Maranhiio, it could soon trigger a collapse in\n                the whole system, perhaps before 30 or 40 per cent of the forest is cleared.'\n                The Indian camp was in the grounds of a mission station outside the town, right on the edge\n                of the forest. Young Kayapo warriors had built huts for their people from tree branches and\n                palm leaves. There were Indians sleeping in hammocks, cooking fish, manioc arid bananas,\n                mothers suckling their babies, their tiny faces painted red with the sap of urucum nuts. Men\n                were carving wooden clubs or making baskets, little boys were playing with their pet\n                monkeys, girls were threading brightly coloured beads into bracelets and necklaces, just as\n                they did in the village back home.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But here they were mobbed by photographers and cameramen, who lapped up the tribal\n                dancing and the bright colours of the jungle culture. They filmed these scenes as they\n                themselves were being filmed by Indians using video cameras.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But in the streets of Altamira people congregated for a great counter-demonstration in\n                support of the Kararao dam. The cattle ranchers had mustered the support of traders and\n                settlers and they all shouted 'we want the dam, we want the dam'. They had been led to\n                believe that dams mean progress and a better life. And Altamira certainly needs progress:\n                everywhere there are holes in the roads, living conditions are atrocious and there are hardly\n                any jobs to be had.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But, in the meeting, scientists stated that big dams mean trouble. The Balbina dam, near\n                Manaus, in particular, only recently completed, proved that point. There were millions of\n                dead trees left standing in the water. A huge area of good land had been flooded, and there\n                were now few fish. New diseases like leishmaniosis were spreading like wildfire. The\n                turbines were corroded by the stinking, acidic water and they produced only a quarter of\n                the electricity that had been anticipated.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians and the ecologists pointed out that progress does not have to mean giant dams\n                and enormous forest fires. Sensitive small-scale development was much more sensible than\n                megaprojects. Amazonia needed a new approach to development that did not devastate the\n                forests.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians told the Brazilian government that they would rather die than suffer further\n                land loss. One old Kayapo woman, Kokumi, took the microphone, an object she'd probably\n                never seen before in her life, and said this to a hushed audience: 'Listen, white man, you\n                have already got plenty of land, and we, the Indians, have only little left. These are our\n                lands, our waters, our forests. Our food depends on the game animals and the resources of\n                the forests and the rivers. I have already many grandchildren, and their health depends on\n                these things. Let us go on to live on our lands in peace.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Altamira gathering may well prove to have been a turning point in the story of the\n                Brazilian Amazon. The Indians had shown that they are a political force to be reckoned with\n                both within the country and well beyond the borders of Brazil. They can now, cautiously,\n                count on a network of supporters that stretches as far as the US Congress, the European\n                Parliament and the British House of Commons.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Indians are, at last, being recognized as guardians of the integrity of the rainforest. Their\n                ancient knowledge is increasingly acknowledged as a vital contribution to scientific\n                understanding. Many new important crops and products which could benefit humanity\n                could be developed from rainforest plants.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                One participant at the Altamira gathering, Anita Roddick, the founder of the Body Shop\n                chain, was inspired to set up a new department to investigate plant oils and dyes used by\n                rainforest tribes like the Kayapo. The company decided to buy several tons of brazil-nut oil\n                from the Kayapo every year, to be incorporated into new cosmetics products. A few other\n                companies are now also purchasing plant products in tribal villages on a fair-trade basis\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                But it is not only the Indians who are experts of the rainforest. Rubber tappers, too, use the\n                forest without destroying it. Their struggle to prevent its further annihilation was\n                highlighted as a result of the murder of rubber tappers' leader Chico Mendes in December\n                1988. For years, he and his fellow rubber tappers and brazil-nut collectors had been fighting\n                the cattle ranchers in order to prevent the conversion of forests into pasture. Mendes had\n                called for the creation of 'extractive reserves' which would enable people to live by\n                harvesting from the forest without killing it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At the Altamira gathering the forest peoples' alliance created by Indian leader Ailton Krenak\n                and Chico Mendes was represented, among others, by one of his successors, Gumercindo.\n                He, too, delivered an eloquent speech: 'The struggle of the rubber tappers and the people of\n                the forest is, above all, a struggle for life. We have to fight for an end to the violence to\n                ourselves and the forest. I think this is the movement's future: to spread across the whole of\n                the Amazon region, with schools in extractive reserves that will be set up throughout; with\n                health-care clinics and co-operatives to market the goods; with research centres where the\n                people of the forest may develop new technologies, so that they can utilize the forest better\n                without it being destroyed.'\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                To the astonishment of the forest people, the outgoing government of President Sarney\n                decided in January 1990 to demarcate the first official extractive reserve in the state of\n                Acre. The Upper Jurua Valley Extractive Reserve covers 500,000, forming one of the world's\n                largest areas marked for environmental preservation. It contains great numbers of rubber\n                and brazil-nut trees. Until recently these were exploited by rubber tappers and Indians on\n                behalf of 'rubber barons' who held their workers under a system of debt bondage. Today a\n                co-operative runs the reserve and guarantees acceptable living conditions for the people\n                living in it.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                There has been a wind of change in the Amazon since the end of the 1980s. The forest\n                peoples' movement has made sure of that, in close co-operation with their allies in Europe\n                and the USA. Constant pressure from environment groups has led to major policy changes.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the summer of 1989, for the first time, the Brazilian government, having created a new\n                environment agency, IBAMA, took measures to reduce the scale of the Amazon fires. For\n                the first time in many years, new subsidies were no longer granted to cattle ranchers for\n                expanding their ranch land by burning the forest. The government rented six helicopters,\n                with which it had to monitor an area the size of Western Europe. Its forest patrols were co-\n                ordinated with the photographs transmitted every day by the Brazilian space agency's\n                satellite, which is able to pinpoint even the smallest fires.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Flying in one of the government helicopters over the state of Acre it was still appalling to\n                see the many forest fires, some of which were evidently illegal. But most were on a small\n                scale, a few dozen acres at a time rather than the gigantic fires covering thousands of acres\n                we had witnessed the year before. Some of the offending landowners were fined but,\n                because many of them are absentee landlords, with addresses in Rio or Sao Paulo, it was\n                often difficult to enforce these fines.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                For the first time in years, there was an overall reduction in the annual forest destruction.\n                But nobody should be under the impression that the destruction has been halted. Logging in\n                the Amazon is on the increase as other tropical-forest countries run out of timber. A mature\n                tree can be worth up to a thousand dollars standing, and more than $ 10,000 in a stack of\n                planks in Belem harbour. And wherever a new logging road is cut, access for slash-bum\n                agriculturalists becomes easier, encouraging predatory settlement in the virgin forest.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                At the beginning of 1990, the new president, Fernando Collor, appointed as his special\n                secretary for the environment Brazil's most radical environmentalist, Dr Jose Lutzenberger.\n                With the president's backing, he promised sweeping changes in the policy for the Amazon,\n                emphasizing just how important these forests are for the ecological future of Brazil and,\n                indeed, for the whole world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Collor administration surprised the world with an enlightened attitude to the Amazon\n                and its peoples, but it remains to be seen whether these will be lasting changes. Many\n                Brazilians resent foreign interference: the Amazon is there to be exploited and foreigners\n                who try to prevent this are meddling in Brazil's internal affairs.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Ultimately, it is only the peoples of the Amazon themselves who can prevent the massacre\n                of the forest by outsiders. Many different groups have shown extraordinary skill and\n                courage in recent years and they need all the support from us they can get!\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Brazil has about 60 per cent of the Amazon forest on its territory, but it extends into eight\n                other countries. Of these, Colombia has a particularly enlightened forest policy. In 1990, the\n                outgoing administration of President Virgilio Barco showed great imagination and far-\n                sightedness by giving title to no fewer than forty-five million acres of Amazon forest to the\n                country's Indians, nearly half the total area of forest in the country, four-fifths the size of\n                Britain. The new Colombian policies were initiated and are now administered by\n                anthropologist Martin von Hildebrand.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Colombia has taken the world lead in recognizing its obligations to its Amerindian peoples\n                and in taking steps to stop the devastation of its part of the Amazon forest, which contains\n                some 10 per cent of the world's plant and animal species. There are at least 50,000 species\n                of flowering plants, some 1,750 bird species and 4,000 different kinds of butterflies, and\n                many of these are extremely localized and still known only by Indian names.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The prospects for the Amazon forest look better than they have for a long time. After\n                decades of senseless devastation, we may be heading for a period in which the\n                environmental services of the Amazon forest and of its people are better appreciated.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Sadly, the same cannot, as yet, be said for the rainforests of Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma,\n                Madagascar, the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Zaire and the Congo. In all these countries, the\n                pressure of logging and mining companies and of settlers hungry for land in the rainforests\n                is still enormous. Invariably, indigenous groups are facing the threat of annihilation as the\n                forests are destroyed around them.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                According to Norman Myers, as quoted in ‘Global Warming’, ed. Jeremy Leggett, worldwide\n                destruction of rainforests has recently been occurring at at an annual rate of some 1.8 per\n                cent, 35.5 million acres a year or 67 .5 acres a minute. But in African countries like the Ivory\n                Coast and Nigeria annual loss is presently around 15 per cent, in the Philippines and\n                Madagascar over eight per cent. About 1.4 billion acres of pristine rainforests remain, less\n                than half the area forty years ago, and 52 per cent of these are in just three countries: Brazil,\n                Zaire and Indonesia.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Thailand's example is indicative of what could soon happen elsewhere in the tropics: in\n                thirty years, its forest cover went down from two-thirds to just over a quarter, mainly\n                because of export-oriented logging. With the population doubling, many deforested areas\n                were taken over by slash-burn agriculturalists hungry for land. But landslides in the hilly\n                uplands now frequently endanger the lives of settlers. At present, Thailand's annual forest\n                loss is low, because accessible forests have all but vanished. Today, it feeds its sawmills with\n                timber from Burma, contributing to that country's forest destruction.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                In the lowlands of Thailand, just 50,000 acres of forest are left at Khao Noi Chu chi. Despite\n                its tiny size, this remnant forest contains an astonishing wealth of plant and animal species,\n                including an extremely rare bird called Guerney's pitta, or jewel thrush, famed for its\n                fabulous blue and yellow plumage. Once abundant, it had been thought to be extinct, but\n                was rediscovered in this forest in 1986. Just fifteen to twenty pairs of the jewel thrush are\n                left. It is impossible to say how many other less spectacular plant and animal species will be\n                lost if this last area of lowland forest is destroyed.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Species other than humans have a right to exist. This seems an obvious point, but in recent\n                decades it could not be taken for granted. Only a little over 3 per cent of the surface of the\n                planet is actually legally protected, and even some of these areas continue to be\n                threatened.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Flying over the canopy of the still vast Amazon forest in spring of 1990, I was awed by the\n                sheer abundance and exuberance of this primeval world of trees and water. The rivers\n                wound their way through the green land below us, intertwined with each other and with the\n                forest like giant snakes. They were not confined for ever to permanent beds of their own. As\n                they flooded their banks and changed their courses, they had left behind bits of themselves\n                in the flat landscape, so-called oxbow lakes, stretches of water separated from the river of\n                which they were once part.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Here and there the occasional hill rose out of the plain, the sky above it like a mountain\n                landscape of enormous glacier-like clouds suspended in a stark blue sky. This part of the\n                Amazon forest was bathed in glittering light, the crowns of the trees stretched out towards\n                us, their myriad of leaves seeking the sun. But our helicopter was not the sun, only a noisy\n                mobile observation platform for curious visitors from another world.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                Our pilot had been flying over the Amazon for twenty years and he was proud to show us\n                his familiar world. From time to time, he dived down to just above the tree tops to get the\n                birds off their nests or perches so that we could see them better. Of course, with all that\n                engine noise you are unable to hear them screeching and calling out to each other. But we\n                could see them rising from the trees and sailing over the forest - parrots, toucans, eagles\n                and herons, some by themselves, some flying in groups.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The shapes of the trees were of an astonishing variety, the tallest ones laden with orchids\n                and creepers all seeking the power of the sun. Here and there, we saw trees covered in\n                mauve or yellow blossoms, but the helicopter moved on so relentlessly there was no time to\n                become familiar with any single tree or bird or flower. And even the curved horizon moved\n                on, like a mobile theatre set, changing minute by minute.\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                The Amazon is an epic landscape. Forests, rivers and sky are interwoven like a majestic\n                tapestry. I knew that down there, below us, was the greatest assembly of life on Earth, ever\n                changing yet ever constant, never touched by an ice age or other such traumatic event.\n                Who would have thought that humans, even equipped with bulldozers and chain saws,\n                would be able to get the better of such a triumphant world of nature in large parts of the\n                tropics? But now, at last, we are becoming aware that our man-made world will be in peril if\n                these great forests vanish. Perhaps the process of halting the destruction has at last begun.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default Earthrise","import React from 'react';\nimport './Carbon.scss';\n\nclass Carbon extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"carbon\">\n                <div className=\"carbonBanner\"></div>\n                <h3>Carbon and the biosphere</h3>\n                <p className=\"chapterDescription\">This is a slightly abridged version of the second chapter of Herbert Girardet &\n                Miguel Mendonca, ‘A Renewable World’, Green Books, Dartington, 2009, a report\n                to the World Future Council</p>\n                <p>There is growing scientific evidence that to avoid a climate catastrophe in the coming\n                decades we need not just to reduce carbon emissions, but, beyond that, to reduce actual\n                concentrations of CO2 already present in the earth’s atmosphere. This is an agenda that\n                goes significantly beyond the targets currently being pursued by the world’s ‘climate\n                guardians’ such the IPCC.</p>\n                <p>Jim Hansen, the eminent climate researcher and director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for\n                Space Studies, has indicated that the IPCC has been much too cautious in its assessments\n                and that we are rapidly reaching crucial tipping points which compel us to act very rapidly\n                indeed to prevent run-away climate change. In an interview published in 2008 he said this:</p>\n                <p>“Recent greenhouse gas emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate\n                change ... There is already enough carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere for massive ice sheets\n                such as West Antarctica to eventually melt away, and ensure that sea levels will rise metres\n                in coming decades. Climate zones such as the tropics and temperate regions will continue to\n                shift, and the oceans will become more acidic, endangering much marine life. We must begin\n                to move rapidly to the post-fossil fuel clean energy system. Moreover, we must remove some\n                carbon that has collected in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.” 1</p>\n                <p>Hansen’s views have been reinforced by alarming news about melting mountain glaciers and\n                by the unprecedented thinning of polar ice, with the prospect that summer ice in the Arctic\n                may largely disappear in a matter of years. Far more solar energy will be absorbed into the\n                arctic oceans as their colour turns dark as ice dissolves during the summer months. This and\n                other positive feedbacks are the alarm signals of an unprecedented crisis that have led the\n                Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon to refer to a global climate emergency.</p>\n                <p>So, where do we go from here? By 2009 global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have\n                already reached 387 parts per million (ppm), up by 40 per cent from 275 ppm in 1900. Until\n                recently a doubling to 550 ppm was widely regarded as acceptable, but this was revised\n                downwards to some 450 ppm as new scientific evidence about a warming planet emerged.\n                Now most climatologists are profoundly concerned about even this seemingly small increase,\n                and argue for an actual reduction of CO2 concentrations to 350 ppm or below. This goes way\n                beyond scenarios currently being proposed by governments in developed countries.</p>\n                <p>The problem is that every year we are now discharging nearly 10 billion tonnes of carbon into\n                the atmosphere. Of this, four to five billion tonnes are not being reabsorbed into the world’s\n                ecosystems, but are accumulating in the atmosphere. Are there possibilities to absorb\n                surplus greenhouse gas emissions, and, beyond that, to find ways to actually reduce existing\n                GHG concentrations?</p>\n                <p>There has been much talk about the potential of removing carbon by technical means\n                through carbon capture and storage, or geo-sequestration. Yet even if CCS were to succeed\n                on a substantial scale, it will not deal with carbon already present in the atmosphere. We\n                need alternative approaches, and particularly bio-sequestration, which can deal with new\n                emissions as well as existing CO2 concentrations – if done on a large enough scale.</p>\n                <p>For global temperatures to stabilise, carbon emissions must ultimately not exceed what can\n                be absorbed by the biosphere, the Earth's vegetation, soils and oceans. So, can we find\n                ways to enhance the capacity of the biosphere to absorb CO2?</p>\n                <p>There is no question that this is a controversial issue, particularly regarding the idea of using\n                reforestation for carbon sequestration purposes. For instance, in a joint statement in 2006\n                Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and WWF-UK strongly argued against ‘reforestation sink\n                projects’, mainly because “large-scale monoculture tree plantations often have negative\n                impacts on the environment and forest communities”. 2</p>\n                <p>A number of other publications detail the perceived fallacy of carbon offsets. A report called\n                ‘The Carbon Neutral Myth – Offset Indulgences for your Climate Sins,’ rails against the idea\n                of people in the rich countries obtaining ‘permission’ to burn oil, gas and coal by paying for\n                carbon offsets – more often than not by tree planting projects somewhere in the Global South\n                where “projects are being imposed on communities with little consultation.” 3</p>\n                <p>These objections certainly must be taken seriously. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the need\n                to find ways of enhancing the capacity of the earth’s living environment to absorb carbon. Not\n                only can this help to reduce atmospheric carbon concentrations but, if done right, it can also\n                increase the options for sustainable food and timber production for a growing global\n                population. In a world challenged by climate change and biodiversity loss as well as hunger,\n                it is critically important to undertake new initiatives which can have such multiple benefits.</p>\n                <p>A key point to be considered is that whilst fossil fuel burning has massively increased in the\n                last 300 years, the capacity of the biosphere to absorb it has been significantly reduced at\n                the same time: A frequently quoted figure is that 200 to 250 billions tons of carbon have been\n                lost from the biosphere in the last 300 years. This resulted from -</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>deforestation</li>\n                    <li>biodiversity loss</li>\n                    <li>accelerated soil erosion</li>\n                    <li>loss of soil organic matter</li>\n                    <li>salinisation of soils</li>\n                    <li>costal water pollution and</li>\n                    <li>acidification of the oceans</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>A key argument we need to use is that carbon dioxide should be regarded not simply as a\n                bad that has to be stored in underground caverns out of harm’s way, but that it can be turned\n                into a good that can be used to enhance the wellbeing of the biosphere and humanity. All\n                living beings are primarily made of carbon. Can the disruptive human impact on nature’s\n                carbon cycle, which is causing ever worsening instabilities, be brought back into balance by\n                deliberate action?</p>\n                <h4>A matter of balance</h4>\n                <p>A healthy balance sheet matches income and outgoings – in fact, on the balance sheet of a\n                thriving company or household, income exceeds outgoings. But not so in the world’s global\n                carbon balance sheet: year after year we have been running up ever greater deficits. For\n                instance, WWF’s annual Living Planet Reports indicate clearly that in our dealings with\n                nature we have been creating ever greater imbalances. The annual WWF Living Planet\n                Reports tell us that we are consuming the resources that underpin the world’s ecosystems\n                services much faster than they are being replenished. Humanity’s global ecological footprint\n                now exceeds the world’s capacity to regenerate by about 30 percent. 4 Indisputably, this\n                state of affairs cannot continue.</p>\n                <p>The main constituent of life on earth is carbon, drawn from carbon dioxide in the earth’s\n                atmosphere. It is the chemical basis of all known life, and forms more compounds than any\n                other element, with some ten million so far identified by science. Variations in carbon dioxide\n                levels in the atmosphere have been known for some time to influence the impact of solar\n                radiation on the earth, and with that, the earth’s climate. Around 2,000 gigatonnes of carbon\n                are present in the world’s soils and vegetation and have been fairly constant over the last few\n                million years. The earth’s remaining fossil fuel reserves amount to approximately 1,200\n                gigatonnes, or 1.2 trillion tonnes. Around 900 gigatonnes of these are coal, and the\n                remaining oil and gas reserves each amount to around 150 gigatonnes. 5</p>\n                <p>Over the course of some 300 million years, carbon was drawn down by living organisms from\n                the atmosphere and ‘relocated’ in the earth’s crust, ultimately becoming fossil fuels. These\n                were formed out of biomass that was deposited on the ocean floor by sea organisms, by\n                organic particles that were washed into the sea, and out of plant and animal matter on land\n                which was then covered over by sediments and more decaying organic matter.</p>\n                <p>In the last 300 years we have reversed this process of biological carbon sequestration, and\n                have transferred hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon back into the atmosphere, with\n                increasingly dire consequences. How can we balance the books? How can humanity re-\n                establish a carbon cycle where income and outgoings are matched?</p>\n                <p>This matter is addressed in some detail by the IPCC reports published in recent years, and\n                some mitigation measures have been agreed by the international community. However, new\n                thinking about how large amounts of carbon already present in the atmosphere can be\n                sequestered is now urgently needed.</p>\n                <p>According to the Global Carbon Project, the land and ocean carbon sinks – such as forests\n                and plankton in the ocean – removed about 54 percent, or 4.8 billion tonnes a year of the\n                carbon that humans discharged into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2007. That leaves a\n                carbon surplus of about 4 billion tonnes or so per year, which we need to find ways to reduce\n                or absorb. 6</p>\n                <p>We must take a new look at how better land-use and forest management can further\n                enhance biological carbon sequestration. There has been much discussion about the\n                feasibility of geo-sequestration of CO2 from power stations, refineries, etc. However, there is\n                little doubt now we should prioritise biological carbon capture and storage (BCCS), or bio-\n                sequestration, through deliberate measures of forest protection, reforestation and the\n                improvement of soil by incorporation of compost and ‘biochar’.</p>\n                <p>In this context it is important to realise that well thought out bio-sequestration has multiple\n                benefits to nature and human society: in addition to absorbing surplus carbon, it also offers\n                significant opportunities for biodiversity protection, soil erosion prevention and, potentially,\n                enhanced food production and poverty reduction in rural areas. This could even help to\n                enhance the economic viability of rural communities in an age in which billions of people\n                have been forced to move to cities for a better life/ to earn a better living.</p>\n                <h4>Forests for life</h4>\n                <p>Global forest cover extends to nearly 4 billion hectares, or 30 percent of the world’s land\n                surface. 7 The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recently done a Forest\n                Resources Assessment which states that the world’s forests contain 638 gigatonnes of\n                carbon – which is more than the total carbon contained in the atmosphere. 8</p>\n                <p>Forest ecosystems are crucially important components of the global carbon cycle in several\n                ways. They remove some 3 billion tonnes of carbon every year through net growth,\n                absorbing nearly 30 percent of all C02 emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation. 9</p>\n                <p>Healthy forests also play a crucial role as global ecological life-support systems. Reports\n                such as UNEP’s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment make it clear that the goods and\n                services provided by forests are worth trillions of dollars to the global economy. In addition to\n                carbon sequestration, they provide a wide range of ‘ecosystem services’ of benefit to all life:\n                they are wildlife habitats, biodiversity centres, climate regulators and watershed protectors –\n                not to mention medicine cabinets and cosmetics counters. These services are effectively of\n                no cost to human society, and they are absent from humanity’s balance sheet and their\n                critical contributions to the viability of life on earth are largely overlooked in decision-making.\n                This problem needs to be urgently addressed: we need to recognise forests as important\n                natural assets with economic and social value and do what is necessary to promote their\n                protection and regeneration. 10</p>\n                <p>As human populations and their economies grow, so do the resource demands imposed on\n                ecosystems and the impacts of our collective, global ecological footprint. But society is\n                coming to realise that as ecosystem services are threatened across the world, there is an\n                urgent need to evaluate both their immediate and their long-term benefits to humanity.\n                Increasingly, researchers have been able to quantify the economic value associated with\n                ecosystem services based on assessing the cost of replacing these with ‘man-made’\n                alternatives. 11</p>\n                <div className=\"carbonFig\"></div>\n                <h4>Source: UN (FAO) State of the World’s Forests 2001</h4>\n                <h4>Deforestation, a global problem</h4>\n                <p>Deforestation, particularly in the tropics, has long been regarded as a major environmental\n                problem. It is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions and one of the\n                primary contributors to climate change. The IPCC estimates that is responsible for 18 to 20\n                percent of global carbon emissions. Deforestation today is concentrated in a few developing\n                countries, primarily in the tropics, but countries all over the world will ultimately benefit from\n                forest protection. So, new international forest conservation efforts are urgently needed.</p>\n                <p>According to the FAO, between 2000 and 2005, the global annual net loss of forest area was\n                7.3 million hectares per year, mainly in the tropics. 12 Given that tropical forests absorb about\n                500 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, this represents a loss of CO2 sequestration capacity of 3.65\n                billion tonnes. 13 As well as being a major threat to the climate, deforestation also affects 1.6\n                billion of the world’s poorest people who directly depend on forests for their survival. 14\n                Processes of deforestation vary from continent to continent. In South America it is driven\n                primarily by logging and the expansion of large-scale farming, primarily to produce beef and\n                Soybeans; in South East Asia forests are being cleared primarily for timber production and\n                for the expansion of oil palm and coffee for global markets.</p>\n                <p>The economic impacts of deforestation are immense. A 2008 study headed by Deutsche\n                Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev, entitled The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity\n                (TEEB), estimates that destruction of forests internationally is causing economic damage to\n                the tune of $2 to $5 trillion, or up to seven percent of the global economy, annually. This\n                calculation was done by placing value on the various services that healthy forests provide for\n                free, such as carbon sequestration, food supply and water storage. Sukhdev emphasises\n                that the cost of this decline dwarfs the recent losses on the financial markets. \"It's not only\n                greater but it's also continuous, it's been happening every year, year after year.” 15</p>\n                <p>The Global Canopy Programme (GCP) – an alliance of 37 scientific institutions in 19\n                countries – is a world leader in forest canopy research, education and conservation. The\n                programme proposes realistic new ways of compensating countries and companies for\n                protecting their forests, in their own interest as well as the interest of the world community.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Mitchell, director of GCP, says that tropical rainforests are the ‘elephant in the living\n                room of climate change’. 16 In other words, their presence may be overwhelmingly obvious,\n                but few people know how to deal with it. His perspective is supported by the 2006 Stern\n                Review which states that deforestation from 2008-2012 will be responsible for more\n                greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than aviation since the invention of the aeroplane until at\n                least 2025. It says that curbing deforestation should be regarded as a highly cost-effective\n                way of reducing GHG emissions. 17</p>\n                <h4>A view from the Amazon</h4>\n                <p>In its entirety the Amazon Basin covers some 7 million square kilometres. The lion’s share,\n                some 5 million square kilometres, is in Brazil, and the remainder stretches across eight other\n                countries. At least 60 percent of the world’s remaining tropical rainforests, with their\n                unsurpassed biodiversity - including some 55,000 different plant species - are to be found in\n                the Amazon. Moreover, the forests in the Amazon Basin contain at least one-fifth the\n                equivalent of all the carbon currently in the atmosphere, and recent studies show that intact\n                Amazonian forests are also functioning as a globally significant carbon sink, even absorbing\n                some of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from industrial emissions. 18</p>\n                <p>Deforestation for logging, cattle ranching, Soybean production, mining and smallholder\n                farming has so far affected about 20 percent of the Amazon forest, with the greatest impacts\n                in the eastern and southern Amazon. Major concerns are not only carbon loss as a result of\n                deforestation, but also changes in the moisture transfer across vast areas.</p>\n                <p>The Amazon basin is an enormous heat engine, taking heat from the sun, turning it into\n                water vapour and powering tropical air circulation. It has been shown through modelling by\n                two Russian climate scientists that the multi-layered canopy of rainforests is ideal for the\n                transfer of water through cloud formation over long distances – the so-called ‘River in the\n                Sky. For instance, the only way water will transfer from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes is\n                through the canopy of the Amazon rainforest. 19</p>\n                <p>A report “Drought Sensitivity of the Amazon Rainforest” published by Science Magazine in\n                March 2009, presents evidence that the Amazon rainforest is very sensitive to drought –\n                which is likely to intensify under global warming. The 25 year study, which involved some 68\n                scientists, has used the severe drought that struck the Amazon in September 2005 as a\n                ”unique opportunity to directly evaluate the large-scale sensitivity of tropical forest to water\n                deficits”. The study concluded that drought causes massive carbon loss in the forest - mainly\n                through killing trees that were not able to tolerate the drier soil conditions. 20</p>\n                <p>The researchers found that the Amazon forest normally absorbs nearly 2 billion tonnes of\n                carbon dioxide each year, but in 2005 the dry conditions caused it to lose more than 3 billion\n                tonnes of living biomass. “The total impact of the drought - 5 billion extra tonnes of carbon\n                dioxide in the atmosphere - exceeds the annual emissions of Europe and Japan combined”,\n                stated the press release from Leeds University, which led the research.</p>\n                <p>Covering the research in The Independent newspaper, Steve Connor wrote: “The Amazon\n                has long been the lungs of the world. But now comes dramatic evidence that we cannot rely\n                on it in the fight against climate change”. 21</p>\n                <p>Since the 2005 drought, the Brazilian government had some success in lowering the rate of\n                deforestation. In 2006 deforestation was reduced by some 30 percent and all seemed to be\n                going well. However in 2007, with the growing interest in biofuels and rising food prices\n                (which was also partly because of biofuels) deforestation rates shot up again and it was clear\n                that the government did not have deforestation under control. It remains to be seen whether\n                the current world recession has reduced deforestation rates once again.</p>\n                <p>While scientists and climatologists are hesitant about making predictions too far into the\n                future, many believe that the forest system, particularly in the Eastern Amazon, is\n                dangerously close to collapse and that drought could occur regularly in the coming years,\n                with dire consequences for the area beyond, which depends on the Amazon for its rainfall.\n                Brazilian hydrologists have shown that the Amazon basin evaporates some 20 billion tonnes\n                of water daily and that the standing forest helps to lower surface air temperatures through\n                evaporation. This evaporative cooling and the resulting recycling of water is crucial for all the\n                other services provided by the forests, including carbon storage.</p>\n                <p>Many scientists now think that we are approaching a critical point, certainly in the East\n                Amazon. If the forest system were to collapse, this would disrupt huge energy and moisture\n                flows which would have a ‘shockwave’ effect across the world’s climate systems. 22</p>\n                <h4>New demands for forest products</h4>\n                <p>Africa’s Congo Basin Forest, the largest expanse of tropical forest outside the Amazon, is\n                coming under huge pressure from international timber markets. This is epitomised by a story\n                from the environment editor of the Guardian newspaper John Vidal, who visited the region in\n                2007 to write about the logging operations there. In a saw mill he saw several huge trees\n                being cut up and when he asked where the timber was going to end up, the answer was: at\n                the cycle track being built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Rapidly growing economies such as China are scouring the world for timber and other forest\n                products. China now buys 55 percent of the Republic of Congo’s timber exports which come\n                almost entirely from virgin forests. 23 Increasingly, not only timber but also palm oil and\n                soybeans are being imported from ecologically vulnerable rainforest regions. Malaysia is\n                supplying ever-growing amounts of palm oil from converted rainforests. In 2006 it exported\n                some 14.4 million tonnes of palm oil and of this China imported nearly 3.6 million tonnes. 24\n                In the last 20 years China has become the world's largest importer of whole Soybeans as\n                well as oil and meal by-products. 25 Brazilian Soy exports to China, mainly from the Amazon\n                and former savannah regions in Mato Grosso, increased from one million tons to four million\n                tons between 1999 and 2003. 26</p>\n                <p>“What if China reaches the U.S. consumption level per person?” asks Lester Brown, CEO of\n                the Earth Policy Institute. “If China’s economy continues to expand at eight percent a year, its\n                income per person will reach the current U.S. level in 2031. If at that point China’s per capita\n                resource consumption were the same as in the United States today, then its projected 1.45\n                billion people would consume the equivalent of two thirds of the current world grain harvest.\n                China’s paper consumption would be double the world’s current production. There go the\n                world’s forests.” 27</p>\n                <p>It is, however, important to point out that China is only following in the footsteps of Europe,\n                the US and Japan whose demands have been the primary contributor to deforestation in the\n                tropics until recently, and this continues today despite substantial efforts by environmental\n                lobbies such as the FSC to certify timber and other tropical forests products. We certainly\n                need some new strategies to protect and renew forests around the world.</p>\n                <h4>Ecosystem services and avoided deforestation</h4>\n                <p>The fact the 1997 Kyoto agreement did not address the need to reduce emissions from\n                deforestation is a major problem. This was partly due to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the\n                emissions involved. The negotiators initially had difficulties with the measuring of emissions\n                and setting suitable baselines, but this has since been rectified. In 1997 there was also a\n                major concern that the sheer scale of carbon credits produced from ‘avoided deforestation’\n                would tend to undermine incentives to reduce emissions by other sectors. As a result of\n                these factors, reforestation projects were included in the agreement, but ‘avoided\n                deforestation’ was left out.</p>\n                <p>Today, technological advances such as satellite monitoring technology, have given us\n                accurate measures of both annual forest losses and carbon emissions from deforestation.\n                The notion that avoided deforestation should be included within international carbon markets\n                is now being hotly debated. Many experts feel that without schemes for compensating\n                developing countries for avoided deforestation, any post-Kyoto climate deal will not be able\n                to achieve the global emissions reductions necessary to combat climate change.</p>\n                <p>The Global Canopy Programme says that it is crucial to acknowledge that living forests\n                provide valuable climatic services that deforested areas cannot provide, and the overall\n                economic value we place on forests needs to reflect this. Thus the only way to curb further\n                deforestation is to put a price on carbon contained in forests and so provide an incentive for\n                developing countries to protect them.</p>\n                <p>New financial incentives are important because the efforts of NGOs to reduce deforestation\n                by appealing to the environmental and social responsibility of producers and consumers\n                have so far had only limited success. Philanthropy has also been on an inadequate scale to\n                deal with such a huge task. The urgency of the climate challenge means we must develop\n                more effective and innovative methods of international cooperation to curb deforestation.</p>\n                <p>There is a complex set of factors behind deforestation and they have to be well understood\n                for any policy framework to be successful. The primary reason is that presently the\n                conversion of forest to other land uses such as farming, plantations and mining is usually\n                more profitable, particularly if it is supported by government policies, subsidies and\n                international trade. Poorly defined property rights, non-transparency, financial gain by elites\n                and weak law enforcement are other causes of deforestation. Any alternative policies\n                intended to counter deforestation must deal with this complex set of issues.</p>\n                <p>Experts agree that ecosystems - and especially tropical rainforests - must be a central part of\n                any post-Kyoto agreement - because it is the most immediate and cost effective way to\n                achieve real and significant reductions in GHG emissions. There is now growing consensus\n                that financial compensation for avoided deforestation is the best way to reduce loss of\n                forests, particularly in the tropics.</p>\n                <h4>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)</h4>\n                <p>Since 2005 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has\n                been trying to create a new international policy framework to counter deforestation. REDD\n                has been developed largely as a result of initiatives by developing countries, led by Costa\n                Rica and Papua New Guinea. It is intended to enable these countries to earn credits for\n                ‘avoided deforestation’. The idea is that developing countries which protect their forests,\n                which can therefore continue to provide essential ecosystem services for the world, should\n                be compensated for doing so. If REDD is to be part of a post-2012 climate deal, agreement\n                must be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>\n                <p>If REDD is to work effectively it needs to address carbon emissions, biodiversity, ecosystem\n                services and rural poverty alleviation all at the same time. Above all else, it must help assure\n                sustainable livelihoods of forest-dependent communities.</p>\n                <p>A crucial issue is for local communities, who have lived with and depended on the forests for\n                centuries, to participate in designing REDD schemes and to benefit from them. REDD\n                schemes will only work if it is clear who is to be compensated and how. For that reason it is\n                important to strengthen the capacity of forest protection agencies to assure that the rewards\n                for avoided deforestation reach the right people and do not just end up in the hands of\n                corrupt officials, cattle ranchers, and palm oil and logging companies.</p>\n                <p>A pre-emptive scheme for compensating those who have never deforested will be rather\n                difficult to measure, but would be fairer. The Global Canopy Programme has proposed\n                Proactive Investment in Natural Capital (PINC) as a complimentary framework to REDD.\n                PINC would reward nations and landowners for the ecosystem services that protected\n                forests provide. A critical issue is to work out the present value of the forests to be protected\n                and this needs much careful thought and monetary calculation.</p>\n                <h4>Reforestation benefits: carbon and timber</h4>\n                <p>Currently the CDM under the Kyoto Treaty considers only afforestation and reforestation as\n                acceptable carbon sequestration activities. Whilst it is widely accepted that protecting\n                existing forests is much more effective for carbon storage than reforestation and the\n                afforestation of degraded land, major tree planting initiatives are under way in different parts\n                of the world. Reforestation certainly has an important additional role to play in countering the\n                build-up of carbon in the atmosphere:</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Carbon sequestration: New plantations can sequester carbon from the atmosphere at a\n                rate of between 5 and 15 tonnes per hectare per year.</li>\n                    <li>Timber supplies: Although reforestation can provide no substitute for the ecosystem\n                services provided by primary forests, the world needs timber, and this demand should be\n                met from plantations, not from the standing forest, wherever possible.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>It is important to point out that monoculture plantations of trees such as spruce or eucalyptus,\n                which are to be grown on former forest land for the purpose of carbon sequestration, should\n                not be encouraged by international policy. It seems important to restate that we must look\n                beyond the role of forests as carbon sinks – they can provide many other important services,\n                as we have seen above.</p>\n                <p>There are some interesting examples of tree planting initiatives which set out to recreate\n                natural forest ecosystems: ‘Analogue Forestry’, for instance, aims to reproduce the mixed\n                multi-layered ecosystems that a diverse forest provides. And ‘agroforestry’, by which a\n                variety of tree crops – including legumes – are produced on the same plot of land, is the\n                most natural way of planting forests which can provide food, animal fodder and timber at the\n                same time, whilst also capturing carbon from the air. Importantly, it can also help to restore\n                the fertility of depleted soils for the benefit of local communities.</p>\n                <h4>UNEP’s Billion Tree Campaign</h4>\n                <p>Reforestation, and the afforestation of degraded land, takes great effort and major\n                investments, and the financial returns have to be counted in decades rather than years.\n                Nevertheless, very substantial tree planting efforts are now under way across the world.</p>\n                <p>The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP’s) Billion Tree Campaign was\n                launched in 2006 and is backed by Waangari Maathai, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and\n                founder of Kenya’s Green Belt Movement (which initiated the planting of some 40 million\n                trees in Kenya.) The Billion Trees Campaign has encouraged people all over the world –\n                from private individuals and community groups, to businesses and governments – to plant\n                anything from just a handful to several million trees. Initially the target was to plant one billion\n                trees in 2007, but the success of the campaign has led to the much more ambitious goal of\n                planting seven billion trees by the end of 2009. By December 2008 a total of 4.2 billion trees\n                had been pledged and almost 2.6 billion planted.</p>\n                <p>Speaking in February 2009, Wangari Maathai appealed to Heads of State around the world:\n                \"Imagine soldiers marching for the planet. While the armies of the world are waiting to fight\n                an enemy that comes with a gun, we have another enemy, an unseen enemy, an enemy that\n                is destroying our environment. The enemy that takes away our topsoil, takes away our\n                waters, destroys our forests, destroys the air we breathe, clears the forest. This is the\n                unseen enemy and it cannot be fought with a gun. This enemy can be fought with a tree. So\n                you can imagine how wonderful it would be if every soldier on this planet started seeing\n                himself and herself as a soldier for the planet, holding a gun on one side and a tree seedling\n                on the other, to fight this unseen enemy which is actually more dangerous to us than the\n                other enemy.\"</p>\n                <p>In Africa, Ethiopia has become a major tree planting success story. In four decades,\n                Ethiopia’s forest cover had dropped from 40 to just 2.7 percent. But spurred on by UNEP’s\n                Billion Tree Campaign, Ethiopia has planted more trees than any other nation – some 700\n                million in the last few years. Tewolde Egziabher, head of the country's Environmental\n                Protection Authority, says that the combination of tree planting and development of organic\n                farming has started to greatly improve the condition of rural communities in Ethiopia.</p>\n                <p>China, too, has undertaken very large-scale tree planting schemes, talking of a ‘Great Green\n                Wall.’ It has established 24 million hectares of new forests and natural forest regrowth – an\n                area the size of the UK – to transform previously denuded landscapes, particularly in major\n                watersheds, and has been able to offset some 21 percent of its fossil fuel emissions in 2000.\n                28</p>\n                <p>There are also major success stories from South America: Cuba has done much tree\n                planting. Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, just 13.4 percent of the country was covered\n                by trees. In the last 50 years the government's planting program has nearly doubled the\n                national forest cover to some 25 percent. According to FAO, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile and\n                Costa Rica are the four Latin American countries that have implemented very successful\n                reforestation efforts. 29</p>\n                <p>These examples are heartening, but much, much more needs to be done. Balancing forest\n                protection and renewal, and philanthropy and profit, new ways must be found to safeguard\n                and enhance the condition of the biosphere, the greatest climate regulation system we have\n                at our disposal.</p>\n                <p>Expanding bio-carbon sequestration projects beyond a few pilot schemes requires key\n                measures: such as security of tenure, assured funding streams, political stability and\n                institutional capacity. International carbon projects effectively represent an emerging market\n                opportunity. Only those countries that are well prepared will be able to fully take advantage of\n                this. 30</p>\n                <h4>Farming carbon</h4>\n                <p>The earth’s major natural sinks of CO2 are oceans, forests and, perhaps most importantly,\n                soils. The global soil carbon pool is estimated to amount to 2,500 Gt (gigatons), whereas the\n                biotic (vegetation-based) pool is 560 Gt 31 . What are options for carbon sequestration via\n                soil renewal?</p>\n                <p>A new international climate treaty needs to cast its net much wider than the Kyoto Treaty as\n                regards bio-carbon sequestration. In addition to the inclusion of reforestation and forest\n                conservation, soil carbon storage should be included as an eligible carbon sink. In fact, the\n                IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report in 2007 indicated that carbon sequestration by improved\n                soil management holds very significant mitigation potential. Whilst soils hold less carbon per\n                hectare than forests, the carbon storage potential resulting from improved farming practices\n                is very large indeed.</p>\n                <p>The world’s total agricultural area is about 5 billion hectares, one billion more than for forests.\n                Of this, about 1.5 billion ha (30 percent) is arable land and land under permanent crops, and\n                the remaining 3.5 billion ha is permanent pasture. In addition, there are also up to 2.5 billion\n                ha of rangelands.</p>\n                <p>Soils naturally contain large amounts of carbon, derived from decayed vegetation. But the\n                last few decades have seen a dramatic loss of top soil, soil carbon and inherent soil fertility\n                due to unecological farming methods, and the one-way traffic of food supplies from rural\n                areas to cities without the return of carbon back to farmland where the food was grown. An\n                FAO report states that: “most agricultural soils have lost anything between 30 and 75 percent\n                of their antecedent soil organic carbon pool, or a total of 30 to 40 t C ha. Carbon loss from\n                soils is mainly associated with soil degradation … and has amounted to 78+/- 12 Gt since\n                1850. Thus, the present organic carbon pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their\n                potential capacity. … Considering all greenhouse gases, the global technical mitigation\n                potential from agriculture is between 1.5 and 1.64 gigatonnes of carbon equivalent per year\n                by 2030. Soil carbon sequestration is estimated to contribute about 89 percent to this\n                mitigation potential”. 32</p>\n                <p>All over the world soil and soil carbon (humus) is disappearing through erosion and through\n                harvesting crops that end up being consumed in distant cities. In recent years there has been\n                much talk about the world approaching ‘peak oil’, but perhaps even more importantly we\n                have actually passed the point of 'peak soil' decades ago. All over the world topsoil is being\n                lost on a massive scale. Says Professor David Pimentel of Cornell University: \"Soil erosion is\n                second only to population growth as the biggest environmental problem the world faces. Yet,\n                the problem, which is growing ever more critical, is being ignored because who gets excited\n                about dirt?\" 33</p>\n                <p>We urgently need international policy measures to restore soils to their previous levels of\n                fertility and water holding capacity and to stop the ongoing release of carbon stored in soils,\n                the world's second largest carbon sink, and potentially the world’s most effective carbon\n                capture and storage system.</p>\n                <p>The impacts of soil erosion and carbon loss on world food production have been masked to\n                some extent by an ever-greater array of technologies used in farming which have produced\n                higher yields – however unsustainably derived. But now we need to find ways to sequester\n                much more carbon from the atmosphere by developing bold initiatives on renewing the\n                world’s living systems, including life in the soil. It is time to find ways of replacing the one-way\n                linear systems of resource depletion, consumption and pollution that have prevailed in the\n                recent past with circular systems which can replenish nature and assure a sustainable\n                human existence on earth.</p>\n                <p>It is becoming apparent that the restoration of wastelands, degraded or desertified soils and\n                ecosystems can dramatically enhance soil organic carbon content and soil quality. Such\n                management practices include –</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>organic farming</li>\n                    <li>conservation tillage</li>\n                    <li>application of mulch, manure and compost</li>\n                    <li>use of cover crops</li>\n                    <li>agroforestry practices</li>\n                    <li>improved pastures management</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>Farmers need support to alleviate agriculture’s contribution to climate change by reducing\n                tillage, increasing organic soil matter, improving grassland management, restoring degraded\n                lands, planting trees and altering animal husbandry systems. 34 These sorts of practices not\n                only enhance the fertility but also the water storage capacity of soils, and thereby increase\n                farmland productivity. Restoration of soil organic matter can reverse farmland degradation,\n                which is urgently needed in many parts of the world. Not only can this help increase food\n                security, but its can also reduce the use of fossil fuels and its associated GHG emissions.</p>\n                <p>The FAO states that soil carbon sequestration can take effect very quickly and is a cost-\n                effective win-win approach which combines mitigation, adaptation, increased resilience and\n                the promise of more reliable and increased crops yields.</p>\n                <p>“Soil carbon storage was hitherto left out of international negotiations because of envisaged\n                difficulties of validation of amounts and duration/permanency of sequestration. However, in\n                addition to the undisputable multiple benefits of soil carbon storage, soil sampling for\n                verification purposes is less expensive and more accurate than the indirect estimation of\n                carbon stored in living biomass.</p>\n                <p>The FAO has recently prepared a Global Carbon Gap Map that identifies land areas of high\n                carbon sequestration potentials and is developing local land degradation assessment tools\n                that includes a simple field measurement of soil carbon. FAO is also working on tools to\n                measure, monitor and verify soil carbon pools and fluxes of greenhouse gas emissions from\n                agricultural soils, including cropland, degraded land and pastures.”</p>\n                <p>All in all, the potential for soil carbon sequestration is very large indeed and deserves to be\n                incorporated into the post-Kyoto regime. 35 With populations expected to grow to nine billion\n                by 2050, and with increasingly uncertain oil and water supplies, well-thought out new\n                approaches to securing carbon-rich organic soils can help to secure the food supplies of\n                future generations. We need policies to renew the world's soils in closed-loop, low-input\n                farming systems based on a sustainable relationship between urban food consumers and\n                rural farming communities.</p>\n                <p>“Millions of farmers around the globe could become agents of change helping to reduce\n                greenhouse gas emissions. … Agricultural land is able to store and sequester carbon.\n                Farmers that live off the land, particularly in poor countries, should therefore be involved in\n                carbon sequestration to mitigate the impact of climate change,” said Alexander Mueller, FAO\n                Assistant Director-General at a conference in Bonn. 36</p>\n                <p>A potential major additional benefit of measures to support soil quality and carbon\n                sequestration could be to halt or even reverse migration from rural areas to the cities.\n                Funding for enhanced soil carbon sequestration could thus have major environmental as well\n                as economic and social benefits.</p>\n                <h4>The promise of Biochar</h4>\n                <p>In addition to measures for enriching farmland and pastures with ‘conventional’ organic\n                matter, a very significant new option is becoming available under the heading of ‘Biochar’.\n                This system term draws on ancient farming practices that have been used in the tropics.</p>\n                <p>In 1542, the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana was the first European to travel down\n                the Amazon River near Ecuador. While he never found El Dorado, the city of gold he was\n                looking for, he found densely populated regions along the river. He reported that the jungle\n                area held a sedentary farming population, with many large villages and towns, and even\n                large, walled cities. The population levels he saw possibly exceeded even those of found in\n                the Amazon region today. Sadly, the arrival of Europeans also introduced new diseases\n                which appear to have wiped out a large part of the Indian population within decades.</p>\n                <p>Because they used only wood as their construction material, the populations seen by\n                Orellana and his companions did not create lasting monuments that visitors can see today,\n                but they did leave behind dark, fertile soil in many river-side locations. The Amazonians of\n                centuries ago appear to have produced charcoal by burning plant material in pits covered\n                with earth. They then mixed this ‘biochar’ with organic wastes to create dark, fertile soil. This\n                ‘terra preta’ can still be found across the Amazon basin - some 60 locations with deep rich,\n                dark soil often containing pottery fragments have so far been identified. 37</p>\n                <p>Amazonian Indians today still produce charcoal by burning areas of forest to turn them into\n                gardens in a process called slash-burn agriculture. But the ash produced in this way is\n                mainly left on top of the soil and not dug in and neither is it mixed with organic wastes. The\n                people from the river-side settlements seen by Orellana are long gone, but the dark, deep,\n                fertile soil they cultivated over thousands of years remains.</p>\n                <p>Terra Preta soils contain far more charcoal then soil found elsewhere in the Amazon.\n                Scientific research has shown that the porous quality of the biochar these soils contain\n                allows them to harbour a vast variety and quantity of soil microrganisms. The biochar\n                particles can be retained in the soil for centuries and they can improve soil structure,\n                enhance the presence of micro-organisms and plant nutrients. In addition, adding biochar to\n                the soil not only enhances fertility and life in the soil, but also helps it to retain moisture –\n                which is very important in an age of climate change.</p>\n                <p>Research into biochar started in Holland in the 1960s and there are now hundreds of\n                research programmes into various aspects of biochar across the world. A recent book,\n                ‘Biochar for Environmental Management – Science and Technology’, edited by Prof.\n                Johannes Lehmann, is a state-of-the-art compilation about all aspects of biochar written by\n                some 50 researchers. Tim Flannery , the eminent Australian naturalist, and a member of the\n                World Future Council, states this in his foreword: “This book, I believe, provides the basic\n                information required to implement the single most important initiative for humanity’s\n                environmental future. The biochar approach provides a uniquely powerful solution: it allows\n                us to address food security, the fuel crisis and the climate problem, and all in an immensely\n                practical manner. Biochar is both an extremely ancient concept and one very new to our\n                thinking. … Yet few farmers living today have heard about biochar.” 38</p>\n                <p>’Modern biochar’ is produced by pyrolysis (low-oxygen combustion) of organic materials –\n                forest thinnings, sawdust, agricultural wastes, urban organic wastes or sewage solids – and\n                the resulting charcoal-like substance can be incorporated into farmland as a long-term\n                carbon storage option. Importantly, Biochar is also claimed to convert carbon from the\n                atmosphere into stored carbon in soil. Unlike natural decay or the combustion of organic\n                matter, the pyrolysis process releases only a fraction of the carbon content of the source\n                material into the atmosphere.</p>\n                <p>By ‘pyrolysing’ one tonne of organic material which contains half a tonne of carbon, about\n                half a tonne of CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil whilst the\n                other half can be used as a carbon-neutral fuel (this equals a quarter of the CO2 absorbed\n                by the plant during its growth). Biochar has the potential to lock the mineral carbon it contains\n                safely away in the soil for centuries. In addition, the ancillary benefits – not just its soil-\n                improving characteristics, but certain by-products of its manufacture – make it economically\n                attractive as well.</p>\n                <p>Research has shown that Biochar can last hundreds to even thousands of years in the soil. It\n                can change soil properties favourably, and help deliver nutrients to plants better than in soil\n                that has not been treated. An ever-growing number of researchers now suggest that Biochar-\n                in-soil practices could be the most cost effective means of reducing carbon in both the\n                atmosphere and oceans.</p>\n                <p>Professor Johannes Lehmann of Cornell University and others have calculated that biochar\n                could remove between 5.5 and 9.5 gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere each year. But\n                those estimates relied on the optimistic assumption that sufficient source material can be\n                found to make biochar. A more widely accepted view is that biochar applications to soil could\n                remove one to two billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere per year. 39</p>\n                <p>A major question that needs an urgent answer is how enough organic matter can be made\n                available to produce significant amounts of biochar. Opponents argue that farming\n                communities in developing countries may be forced to produce fast growing tree\n                monocultures on precious agricultural land to produce biochar to counter climate change for\n                which they are not even responsible. It is certainly true that unlike in Amazonia centuries ago\n                there is not likely to be much spare biomass available to produce the amounts of biochar that\n                may be needed to make a significant difference.</p>\n                <p>Just how can large quantities of biochar be produced? To find an answer to this question it is\n                worth having a look at the sewage works in Bingen, Germany. Here semi-dried sewage\n                sludge is fed via a conveyor belt into a steel container where it is pyrolysed and turned into\n                glittering black granules: the sewage is turned into charcoal. This can then be buried in farm\n                soil and prevented from entering the atmosphere. At the Bingen University of Applied\n                Sciences Dr. Helmut Gerber, the head of the research project, is convinced of the enormous\n                potential of sewage-derived biochar. 40</p>\n                <h4>The potential of salt water crop irrigation</h4>\n                <p>Another new option for carbon storage and additional production of food and timber of great\n                significance is the use of saltwater tolerant plants, such as mangroves and salicorna shrubs.\n                Scientists estimate that saltwater-loving plants could open up half a million square miles of\n                previously unusable territory for crops whilst helping to settle the heated food-versus-fuel\n                debate of recent years. By increasing the world's irrigated acreage by 50 percent, saltwater\n                crops could provide a valuable additional source of biomass.</p>\n                <p>In a recent issue of Science Magazine, two plant biologists argued that \"the increasing\n                demand for agricultural products and the spread of salinity now make this concept worth\n                serious consideration and investment.\"</p>\n                <p>Glenn has been arguing for the value of saltwater farming for nearly thirty years, for both\n                food and fuel production. Glenn’s team estimates that salt-loving crops could be used to\n                produce 1.5 billion barrels of ethanol annually on a swathe of new agricultural land almost\n                five times the size of Texas.</p>\n                <p>Says Glenn: \"I'm convinced that saltwater agriculture is going to open up a whole new\n                expanse of land and water for crop production. Maybe the world hasn't needed a 50 percent\n                expansion in irrigated agricultural land because we've had enough food, but now that biofuels\n                are in the mix, I think it's the way crop production should go.\"</p>\n                <p>There's plenty of previously uncultivated land in the world's coastal deserts and these could\n                play an important role in crop and fuel production. Glenn estimates that 480,000 square\n                miles of unused land around the world could be used to grow salt-tolerant plants, or\n                halophytes. While salt damages most plants, these salt-loving plants actually use the\n                saltwater to draw in fresh water. In essence, they make themselves saltier than the\n                surrounding water, which, through osmosis, drives fresh water into the plant. One particular\n                plant, Salicornia, produces 1.7 times more oil per acre than sunflowers, a common source of\n                vegetable oil.</p>\n                <p>Halophytes could also be part of the solution to another environmental problem: heavily-\n                salinated wastewater from large farms. Right now, this is dumped into manmade wetlands.\n                For example, in California, the Imperial Valley authorities dump their salty water into the\n                Salton Sea. After absorbing 80 years of agricultural runoff, the Salton Sea is 25 percent\n                saltier than the ocean, and is facing serious ecological problems. Instead of pumping\n                salinized water into these wetlands, the farms could capture that wastewater and use it to\n                grow halophytes.</p>\n                <p>But even if halophytes can help solve some of the world's environmental problems, one has\n                to be realistic about the difficulties of changing agricultural systems. Says Glenn: \"I started in\n                aquaculture back in the early 70s and we thought, golly, aquaculture is going to save the\n                world. Looking back, it's been 35 years, but over half of the key fisheries products come from\n                aquaculture, it just took longer than people thought,\" Glenn said. \"I think it's the same thing\n                with saline crop production.\" 41</p>\n                <p>In addition to salicornia, it would be possible to replant mangroves in estuaries and marine\n                shorelines where they have been cut down, in areas affected by salinisation or in places that\n                are deliberately flooded with saltwater or brackish water. Mangroves are found in tropical and\n                sub-tropical tidal areas that have a high degree of salinity. There are about 110 species of\n                mangroves, and apart from the benefit of their rapid growth they are also provide habitats for\n                a great variety of living species, and act as nurseries for fish and other marine species.\n                Layers of soil and peat which make up the mangrove substrate have a high carbon content\n                of 10 percent or more, and a hectare of mangrove forest can sequester about 1.5 tonnes of\n                carbon per year. 42</p>\n                <h4>The trouble with the oceans</h4>\n                <p>The oceans of the world absorb about one third of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from\n                the burning of fossil fuels - mainly through the growth of plankton. However, this valuable\n                ecological service comes at a high price – the acidification of the oceans. When CO2\n                dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid and the pH of the water decreases as a result.\n                Since the industrial revolution began, it is estimated that surface ocean pH has dropped by\n                slightly less than 0.1 units, equating to approximately a 25 percent increase in acidity. This\n                rate of change is a great cause for concern as there is no evidence that the world’s oceans\n                have ever experienced such a rapid a process of acidification. By the end of this century, pH\n                could be three times lower and the change could be 100 times faster than that experienced\n                during the transitions from glacial to interglacial periods. 43 The effects of ocean acidification\n                are predicted to put maritime ecosystems at major risk and there is an emerging consensus\n                that the average pH of surface waters should be prevented from dropping by more than 0.2\n                units below the pre-industrial value. 44</p>\n                <p>While the full ecological consequences of these changes are still uncertain, it appears likely\n                that many calcifying species, such as corals and shell fish, will be affected. This could have\n                adverse effects on climate change, both by reducing the bio-capacity of the oceans and by\n                decreasing the earth's albedo via the effect of their bio-productivity on oceanic cloud cover.\n                Global reductions of carbon emissions, with simultaneous efforts to enhance the capacity of\n                the terrestrial biosphere to absorb carbon, are clearly urgently called for.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile there are other aspects of what is happening to the oceans that have received\n                much less attention. The massive growth of cities along rivers and in coastal regions all over\n                the world has also led to a tremendous increase in the discharge of sewage into coastal\n                waters. This represents a tremendous transfer of both carbon and soil fertility from rural\n                areas into the sea. All over the world polluted coastal waters cloud sea bed vegetation,\n                reducing its bio-productivity. At the same time, algal blooms remove oxygen from the water\n                and further affect its productivity.</p>\n                <p>It seems evident that vigorous efforts to clean up coastal water and to enhance their bio-\n                productivity need to be considered as an integral part of any strategy to enhance the bio-\n                sequestration capacity of planet earth. Together with initiatives to reduce the acidification of\n                the oceans, these are matters that need to be addressed urgently. 45</p>\n                <h4>Conclusion</h4>\n                <p>Given the many variables involved, it was beyond the scope of this chapter to add up\n                precisely which measures of biosphere and soil restoration will add up to the sequestration of\n                specific amounts of greenhouse gases. Certainly, major investments combining forest\n                protection, reforestation, soil enhancement and coastal water restoration – for the purpose of\n                removing and storing carbon from the atmosphere – need to be conceptualised very carefully\n                indeed. Significant new policy measures and financial flows to rural areas and communities\n                will be needed to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>\n                <p>This message has not been lost on scientific entrepreneurs who are putting forward all kinds\n                of fancy solutions for coming to the aid of the planet: genetically engineered eucalyptus, pine\n                trees and oil palms, the Super Kiri tree, the kenaf plant, and jatropha and other ‘miracle\n                crops’ are being proposed both for carbon sequestration and alternatives to fossil fuels. But\n                rarely is the question being addressed where the water and plant nutrients needed for\n                growing vast acreages of super-fast growing monocultures are likely to come from.</p>\n                <p>It is a major challenge for the international community to come up with suitable funding\n                mechanisms for level-headed bio-sequestration in all the various forms in a new Kyoto\n                Treaty. Many carbon off-set schemes are already available – both commercial and non-\n                commercial. The successor to the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto\n                Agreement, which is intended to transfer funds from developed to developing countries for\n                the benefit of climate protection, must incorporate proposals that benefit both local\n                communities as well as the global human community. By initiating well thought-out measures\n                to improve the carbon sequestration potential of the biosphere we will also be investing in the\n                sustainability and viability of rural communities in the face of rampant urbanisation.</p>\n                <p>In the 1930s President Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps to ‘conserve our\n                natural resources and create future natural wealth.’ Today an Earth Corps could be set up for\n                a similar purpose and provide meaningful work for people who want to dedicate themselves\n                to restoring the health of our planet for future generations.</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>www.scribepublications.com.au/book/climatecodered</li>\n                    <li>FOE, Greenpeace and WWF, Joint statement on offsetting carbon emissions,\n                    www.wwf.org.uk/filelibrary/pdf/august06.pdf</li>\n                    <li>Kevin Smith, The Carbon Neutral Myth – Offset Indulgences for or Climate Sins, Transnational Institute, 2007\n                    www.tni.org/detail_pub.phtml?&know_id=56</li>\n                    <li>WWF, Living Planet Report 2008, www.panda.org/lpr/08</li>\n                    <li>Wikipedia, carbon, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon</li>\n                    <li>Global Carbon Project, www.globalcarbonproject.org</li>\n                    <li>IPCC, Mitigation of Climate Change, UNEP, 2007</li>\n                    <li>www.coolearth.org/rainforest-fact-file</li>\n                    <li>Josep Canadell, Managing Forests for Climate Change Mitigation, Science Magazine, Vol. 320, 13 th June 2008</li>\n                    <li>www.fs.fed.us/ecosystemservices/</li>\n                    <li>Wikipedia, ecosystem services, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services</li>\n                    <li>FAO, Deforestation continues at an alarming rate,\n                    www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2005/1000127/index.html</li>\n                    <li>Nicholas Stern, A Blueprint for a Safer Planet, Bodeley Head, London, 2009</li>\n                    <li>www.fern.org/media/documents/document_837_838.pdf</li>\n                    <li>Pavan Sukhdev http://teebweb.org/</li>\n                    <li>As 6.</li>\n                    <li>As 13.</li>\n                    <li>Peter Bunyard in Herbert Girardet, ed., Surviving the Century, Earthscan, London, 2007</li>\n                    <li>A.M.

         Forest plants have been the source of the most effective drugs in the history of pharmacology – from the common aspirin to a leukaemia drug derived from the rosy periwinkle. \n                    But so far only two per cent have been screened for their pharmaceutical potential. \n                    Jungle Pharmacy looks at research into the commercial possibilites of plant remedies, and explores the traditional knowledge of the shamen – the tribal healers in Peru and Brazil who use plant remedies to cure a variety of illnesses. \n                    US anthropologist Darrell Posey
