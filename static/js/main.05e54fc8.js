Tropical soils are usually less fertile than the soils of the temperate zones. The main reason is the high metabolic rate of living beings in the moist tropical climate. In the rainforest, most trees drop a few leaves all the year round and as they reach the ground fungi, caterpillars or herbivores munch them up. Leaves are thus quickly converted back into plant food, which is then rapidly absorbed by the soil, to be used by the roots of trees and shrubs for new growth. Trees actually contain much of the fertility present in forests, and a thick layer of leaf mould never accumulates as it does in temperate forests. Thus tropical forest soils converted into farmland are usually deficient in humus, and settlers find it hard to use them for anything other than tree crops. The conversion of tropical forests into pasture is a particularly questionable enterprise. This becomes abundantly clear when one travels across the Amazon on the dirt roads that have been built since the sixties, as I have done for many months.

Glenn estimates that 480,000 square miles of unused land around the world could be used to grow salt-tolerant plants, or halophytes. While salt damages most plants, these salt-loving plants actually use the saltwater to draw in fresh water. In essence, they make themselves saltier than the surrounding water, which, through osmosis, drives fresh water into the plant. One particular plant, Salicornia, produces 1.7 times more oil per acre than sunflowers, a common source of vegetable oil."}),(0,Te.jsx)("p",{children:"Halophytes could also be part of the solution to another environmental problem: heavily- salinated wastewater from large farms. Right now, this is dumped into manmade wetlands. For example, in California, the Imperial Valley authorities dump their salty water into the Salton Sea. After absorbing 80 years of agricultural runoff, the Salton Sea is 25 percent saltier than the ocean, and is facing serious ecological problems. Instead of pumping salinized water into these wetlands, the farms could capture that wastewater and use it to grow halophytes."}),(0,Te.jsx)("p",{children:'But even if halophytes can help solve some of the world\'s environmental problems, one has to be realistic about the difficulties of changing agricultural systems.

Looking back, it\'s been 35 years, but over half of the key fisheries products come from aquaculture, it just took longer than people thought," Glenn said.

Mangroves are found in tropical and sub-tropical tidal areas that have a high degree of salinity. There are about 110 species of mangroves, and apart from the benefit of their rapid growth they are also provide habitats for a great variety of living species, and act as nurseries for fish and other marine species.

When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid and the pH of the water decreases as a result. Since the industrial revolution began, it is estimated that surface ocean pH has dropped by slightly less than 0.1 units, equating to approximately a 25 percent increase in acidity. This rate of change is a great cause for concern as there is no evidence that the world\u2019s oceans have ever experienced such a rapid a process of acidification. By the end of this century, pH could be three times lower and the change could be 100 times faster than that experienced during the transitions from glacial to interglacial periods. 43 The effects of ocean acidification are predicted to put maritime ecosystems at major risk and there is an emerging consensus that the average pH of surface waters should be prevented from dropping by more than 0.2 units below the pre-industrial value. 44"}),(0,Te.jsx)("p",{children:"While the full ecological consequences of these changes are still uncertain, it appears likely that many calcifying species, such as corals and shell fish, will be affected.

Global reductions of carbon emissions, with simultaneous efforts to enhance the capacity of the terrestrial biosphere to absorb carbon, are clearly urgently called for."}),(0,Te.jsx)("p",{children:"Meanwhile there are other aspects of what is happening to the oceans that have received much less attention. The massive growth of cities along rivers and in coastal regions all over the world has also led to a tremendous increase in the discharge of sewage into coastal waters.

All over the world polluted coastal waters cloud sea bed vegetation, reducing its bio-productivity. At the same time, algal blooms remove oxygen from the water and further affect its productivity."}),(0,Te.jsx)("p",{children:"It seems evident that vigorous efforts to clean up coastal water and to enhance their bio- productivity need to be considered as an integral part of any strategy to enhance the bio- sequestration capacity of planet earth.
