There was a concert of car horns in the streets of this Wild West town as drivers made sure to avoid each other. They were driving through this infernal landscape as if blindfolded.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The other members of the film crew were waiting in a small hotel. They had gone ahead in another plane. For hours we talked about nothing but the gigantic fires and the smoke-filled landscape. We had intentionally come here at the time of the queimadas, but what we were seeing was obscene beyond imagining.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Redencao was a frontier town straight out of a Wild West movie, Brazilian style. Most of the houses were nailed together from wooden planks. Only in the centre were there stores, bars and large villas that had a sense of concrete permanence about them. The people walking the streets did not give the impression that they were perturbed by the smoke. Even the few Indians we met seemed unconcerned, going about their normal business.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Next day, as we drove out of Redencao, we could see the transformation the Amazon landscape was going through, a transformation quite deliberately planned by the Brazilian generals over twenty years previously. Wherever the road led, trees were being cleared on both sides. There was smouldering forest everywhere, stumps of trees grotesquely projecting up out of the ash-covered soil.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Some standing trees were still burning, with flames shooting out of the branches high up in the sky. An eerie silence was interrupted only by the sound of explosions, as pockets of air expanded and tree trunks burst. Here and there cattle with humps were wandering about aimlessly in the blackened landscape, looking for grass. The fence posts on their pasture had burned down and they had escaped, clearly bewildered by the fires and the smoke. One was limping badly, her hoof apparently singed. Up in the sky, groups of screeching parrots were flying about where only a couple of days ago there had been the crowns of trees, fruit trees, nesting trees. But they were gone, reduced to ashen traces on the smouldering soil.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"And all of this devastation had been wreaked in the name of development. 'Land for people for people without land', that was the government slogan that started it all. But there was not much evidence of peasants and small farms. The last great untouched forest region on earth was being turned into a giant cattle ranch. Never mind that the thin soil was not really suitable for grass. And never mind that the land, when it was still forest, had actually been inhabited by people, other people, forest people who had been living here for tens of thousands of years. Oh, but they were 'primitive' people, weren't they? They were not worthy of survival in a new world of chain saws and sawmills, refrigerated trucks and hydroelectric dams.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Out of the smoke a small town emerged, made up only of huts nailed together from mahogany planks, one of hundreds like it across Amazonia. Gold had been found and people had flocked in from far and wide. They were mostly men, mostly young men with haggard faces looking with suspicion as the minibus full of gringos stopped outside a bar. What were we doing here, anyway? Inside, beer sold at two dollars a bottle and plenty of it was being drunk. A few of the men had mouths full of gold teeth, and fat bellies. They were drinking spirits, and looked at us even more suspiciously than the rest. One of them pulled a handful of small nuggets out of his pocket. Did we want to buy some gold? No thanks, we are only passing through.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The road was full of deep holes and the suspension of the minibus was less than adequate, not to mention the steering. The driver proceeded, nevertheless, as though he were on a racetrack and we held our breath each time we crossed one of those narrow tree-trunk bridges. In several places, smouldering forest giants were lying across the dirt road and we had to screech to a halt. Since it was impossible to move them and as we had no time to wait until they had turned into ash, we were forced to cut holes in the cattle fence with wire cutters, and to drive over the ash-filled pasture until the dirt road was passable again.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Suddenly there was a chain across the road and a sign announcing the Gorotire Indian Reserve. A man came out of his hut, an Amerindian with long black hair. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt like the Indians we had seen in Redencao. He was on guard duty. After we had explained that we had come to film with the Kayapo, he went back to the hut to consult with another man. Then he dropped the chain and let us through. The road narrowed and became more winding. Soon we realized we had come to a different world. Here, for the first time on our journey, we saw the colour green. There were tall trees and it was shady and quite cool. Trees covered in vines, orchids and all kinds of epiphytes rose up on both sides of the track. No two trees seemed alike. Birds were singing and flying about, howler monkeys were shouting at us. There was still smoke in the air, but for the first time for hours there were no fires.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Gorotire is a village made up of modern brick houses. It was not arranged in a circle like traditional Indian villages, but had been built along a central track. The Kayapo in Gorotire live in a world somewhere between ancient and modern. They still wear feather head- dresses, but they also wear white man's clothes. They still paint their faces and bodies, but their brightly coloured glass beads are imported from Czechoslovakia.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The Kayapo greeted us with generous smiles. I had met some of them in Brasilia. The three Gorotire chiefs, Kanhok, Ute and Totoi, and some of the village warriors had been active in the campaign for proper constitutional rights for all Indians. They had stayed in a mission school in the capital and had been driven to the House of Parliament every day to participate at a convention to draw up a new constitution for the country. They had even led lobby discussions, determined at long last to be granted full rights of citizenship in their own country. They had done so in their unique style, chanting and dancing outside parliament clad in their jungle best, their heads dressed in multi-coloured parrot feathers. They had looked magnificent in the air-conditioned lobby of the Hilton Hotel, in a world usually inhabited only by men in grey lightweight suits.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Now, in Gorotire, they greeted us with great warmth. They had been expecting us. We were invited to the men's house and I was given a chance to explain the purpose of our visit to everybody. The documentary we were making was concerned with the Indians' knowledge of the forest and its medicinal plants. Our purpose was to ascertain whether the Indians really were the great experts in forest ecology and in medicinal plant remedies they were reputed to be by some anthropologists.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Beptopup, the shaman we had come to film with, did not live in one pf the modern houses. He preferred a traditional straw and mud hut away from the centre of the village. He welcomed us with the detached curiosity of an old man who had seen many changes in his life. He had the silver-haired looks of a Harvard professor, but he also wore large hoops of glass beads in his ears.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The evening was for dancing and celebrations in which the whole village took part. We were fed a delicious meal consisting of fish, bananas and manioc, steamed in banana leaves. But somehow we were not in a party mood after seeing all those fires: they had reached to within fifteen miles of Gorotire.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The next morning, we got our equipment ready to film with Beptopup, who had said he would take us take us downriver into the forest to show us his medicinal plant garden. Dr Elaine Elisabetsky, director of the school of ethno-pharmacology at Belem University, had visited Beptopup many times before to learn about his use of forest plants. She brought Beptopup and his granddaughter down to the boat. For half an hour we canoed down the Fresco River along banks covered with tall trees. The water was not crystal-clear, as one would expect, but brown with soil from a nearby gold mine. After half an hour in the canoe, we stopped at a small landing stage.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"We followed Beptopup along a narrow forest path. He walked like a young man as he ducked below branches, picking the leaves of plants and wild passion fruit dangling off the trees. The forest interior was full of the sorts of plants that decorate living rooms back home in London or New York: cheese plants, wild pineapple, heliconias, all kinds of orchids, plants with beautifully coloured leaves, and what we call \u2018rubber plants\u2019. They are at home in the moist shade of the forest, which has a constant temperature of some twenty-six degrees centigrade all the year round. The forest is surprisingly cool, but once it is removed, the daytime temperature shoots up to thirty-five or forty degrees under the fierce tropical sun.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Beptopup was in the world he had always known, the forest world of his ancestors. It just happened to be one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. But as anthropologists had established, he and his people knew virtually every living thing in their familiar world. In fact, ehnobiologists from European and American universities who had studied his knowledge, and that of other shamans of Amazonian tribes, had found that they had a name for every plant in the forest and a use for most. And why not? The Amerindians have been in the Amazon for tens of thousands of years, plenty of time to experiment with the use of plants for food and medicine.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"One does not need scientific instruments to learn about the world; our senses; the capacity of our six senses and the knowledge systems passed on from generation to generation will do. Now, at the very moment that many of the forest tribes had been almost wiped out, people are beginning to realize that these are not 'primitives', but world experts on the fauna and flora of the rainforest who have a great deal to teach humanity if we want to utilize the biological resources of the living forest intelligently.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Beptopup understood that we had not come with chain saws and bulldozers like white men usually do, but that our film camera was there to record his forest science and to show the world how his knowledge was profoundly relevant to humanity. Many plants have medicinal uses yet to be explored by modern science. We had not come to tell him and his people what to do, but to listen and to learn. Beptopup's profound familiarity with the world around him was amply illustrated as we walked along together through the green shade of the forest. He unselfconsciously spoke with his granddaughter, Bekwaiti, quietly touching and teaching her the names of plants we encountered on our way deeper and deeper into the jungle.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"After an hour's walk we reached his forest garden. American ethnobiologist Dr Darrell Posey, who spent much time in Gorotire, had told us that it was here that Beptopup had lived for many years of his life with his wife and children away from the village. In the 1960s his fellow tribesmen had threatened to kill him because he could not come up with medicines against the new diseases the white men had brought to the village and which were decimating the Kayapo. He, the shaman and medicine man, was expected to know how to cure all diseases known to them, but now he had no medicines against new diseases like flu, meningitis, TB, whooping cough, measles, polio and virulent strains of malaria. It had all happened so suddenly and there was no time to experiment with forest medicines. Beptopup decided to escape from the anger of his people and to live away from the village. And so he packed his bags and hammock, and he and his wife and children moved away \xb7 deep into the forest.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Some seven years later, he left his forest garden and went back to the village so that his children could be named in the proper ceremony. The tribe welcomed him back because he knew plant remedies that would stop the women from having babies. Many women did not want babies any longer, they said, because the white man was taking the land away from them. They did not want to live in a world without forests, without shade, without birds and monkeys. Could he come and administer the contraceptive remedies?",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"And Beptopup stayed in the village and gave the women the seeds of a particular orchid, and a brew made from the bark of a special tree, and for many years few babies were born in the village. Cattle ranchers burned more and more of the forest nearby and gold-diggers came and carved deep holes in the ground and dumped sludge full of mercury in the Fresco River. The fish were poisoned and people became ill from swimming in the muddy water.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"But the Kayapo, unlike other tribes in the Amazon, were warriors. One day they decided they were no longer going to be messed around, that they would rather die than lose their forests and their dignity. After years of suffering, they took their destiny in their own hands. They brought warriors together from several other villages and one day in 1985 they stormed the gold miners' camp. With war clubs and spears and a few guns they drove the miners into a large shed and locked the doors. They then radioed the Brazilian government and insisted on having their land demarcated before they would release the miners. And they wanted it \u2013 now!",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"And that is what actually happened: within a few days the Brazilian government, after years of inaction, flew in land surveyors and actually demarcated the Gorotire reserve. The Kayapo chiefs negotiated for a share of the gold mine, since they knew they could not get rid of it. After contracts were formally signed, the miners were released by the warriors, who went back to their villages. For the first time in years the Kayapo had some control over their own destiny and could be more optimistic about the future. Today there are many children again in Gorotire. And at night around the camp fires, they are often told the stories of the great victory of the Kayapo over the gold miners and the government.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Beptopup's forest garden was an outcrop of granite rocks several hundred metres across. In the cracks between the rocks, soil had accumulated and this is where he had planted his medicinal plants, remedies his people had used successfully for millennia. He proudly showed us several specimens of an orchid that he had planted (its botanical name Epistephium lucidum), whose seeds he used as the contraceptive he had administered to the women. He insisted: 'Women who take this will have no more babies, no more babies at all. It dries up their wombs, it dries them up completely.'",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The use of the seeds of this particular orchid as a contraceptive has been confirmed by several anthropologists and one missionary who worked with the Kayapo, though their contraceptive action had not yet been tested scientifically. But weeks after we left Brazil, at the pharmacology institute of the University of Chicago, we were able to film a research student, Karen Lowell, who was testing another contraceptive remedy which Peruvian and Ecuadorian Indians call piri-piri. The grass-like plant had turned out to have a definitive contraceptive effect in trials with laboratory mice. Research into this and other Amazonian contraceptive remedies continues. Meanwhile pharmaceutical institutes and companies across the world are screening thousands of tropical forest plants every year for their medicinal efficacy.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Knowledge of plant medicines used by Amerindians is passed on verbally from generation to generation. Tribal people like the Kayapo know that it is the old people who are the best teachers for the young. All children learn some of the ancient plant knowledge as they grow up, but only a few, like Beptopup, become specialists whose comprehensive knowledge is greatly cherished. The appearance of the white man and his new diseases and new medicines caused so much confusion and uncertainty. Now, shamans like Beptopup have new pupils: ethnobiologists like Dr Darrell Posey who have made tribal knowledge of plants and animals the focus of their research. He has written more than a hundred scientific papers on the Kayapo knowledge system.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"This is what he told us: 'Beptopup for many years has been my guide and my teacher. The gap between our cultures is very large and he has been very patient with me. I think he is aware of the fact that his is the last generation with that degree of knowledge. I have come to realize that his is a systematic knowledge which has developed for thousands and thousands of years. It is very rich indeed. Yes, it is science, and a very complex one at that. It is, in fact, a testable knowledge. If we find that it works we can integrate it into our own scientific context.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The Kayapo, who I have studied with, do have plants for controlling fertility, which as we know is an enormous issue all over the planet. But this also raises an ethical issue: we have to find ways to compensate native peoples for the knowledge of medicinal plants which they are contributing. I don't think that we can ethically exploit this knowledge without proper rewards. If we did that it would be nothing more than a form of neo-colonialism, in which we are taking their science, mass-producing it without giving benefits to the native people who are the guardians of that knowledge.'",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"A couple of days after filming in Beptopup\u2019s forest garden, we flew him and his wife to an area outside the Kayapo reserve which had once been their own territory. Now it was by the side of a road full of timber lorries on the edge of a cattle ranch. But Beptopup still recognized the land he had not been back to for fifty years. There were still patches of forest left and Darrell wanted to show us how its species composition was, partly, the result of human presence. The Indians do not leave stone monuments in areas of forest they once inhabited, they leave a modified composition of trees with more fruit and nut trees than areas of 'natural' forest. Such patches of 'modified' forest are clearly identifiable if one flies over the jungle.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Down on the ground, Beptopup started reminiscing about the Kayapo village that once, many years ago, existed in this part of the forest. He pointed out medicinal plants that the villagers had planted on the edge of the forest and which were still there. He told us that they were remedies for treating boils, coughs, diarrhoea, and fungal skin diseases. Then, as we stopped filming, we noticed that his wife, Kukein-Kudjai, a woman in her late sixties, had vanished. Soon we saw her right at the top of a Bacaba palm tree, where she was harvesting the bunches of fruit, much to the delight of her husband, who then started making a basket from the palm leaves.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Only a few hundred yards further on, we stumbled up on a smouldering stretch of forest that had been set alight the day before. Beptopup walked around among the blackened stumps in anger and bewilderment, shaking his head again and again. Then he said: 'Why must the white man always destroy everything? Why does he never plant anything? The white man doesn't like the forest, but the forest is good, the forest looks after us. Why does the white man burn the forest and destroy the trees? Where are the turtles going to live, and the birds? How are my children going to live? What are they going to eat? Where will they get their medicines from? Why does the white man hate the forest so much? ...

In Brazil alone, an area of virgin forest the size of France has been cleared in the the 1970s and \u201880s, some 15 per cent of Brazil's Amazon forests. This does not include the huge areas of forest along the Atlantic coast which vanished during the process of Brazil's colonial conquest. Just three per cent of the Atlantic forest remains. The rest has been annihilated and converted to cattle ranches, soybean farms, and coffee and sugar-cane plantations, and for urban development.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The massive eradication, or 'development', of Brazil's Amazon forest in recent years is the result of deliberate government policy, first formulated by the generals who took over in Brasilia in 1965. At the end of 1966, General Castello Branco unveiled his 'Operation Amazonia' strategy with operatic pomp: he invited 300 of his fellow generals, Brazilian and foreign businessmen, industrialists, bankers and planners on board the pleasure cruiser Rosa de Fonseca for a trip from Manaus up the Amazon. The party discussed the \u2018modernization\u2019 of the Amazon.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The fiscal instruments for this purpose were to be tax breaks, land concessions, trade incentives and all kinds of special credits for the developers. Cattle ranchers, logging companies and mining corporations soon took advantage of the sweeteners on offer from the Brazilian government. In order to facilitate the 'development', a massive programme of road construction was initiated. Once the bulldozers had cut deep gashes into the jungle, the trees on both sides could be cut or burned down. Once the forest was incinerated, grass seeds were spread into the ash by the same means. Often hundreds or even thousands of acres were \u2018developed\u2019 in one fell swoop.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The opening up of the Amazon resulted in an unprecedented boom, with land values as much as doubling every year. Land in the Amazon became a vehicle for capturing incentives and cheap credits, assuming the form of a speculative instrument rather than being an input into agriculture.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The ranchers, loggers and mine developers wanted the Amazon for themselves. But a conflict of interests developed between them and poor migrants. An environmental crisis in the north-east of Brazil and the mechanization of agriculture in the south of the country brought about a flood of peasant farmers to the Amazon in search of the promised land, encouraged by the government. They hoped to have their own small farm, a little house surrounded by mango, avocado, coconut and copuacu trees, a few pigs, a chicken and a cow. They wanted a field for growing subsistence crops like rice, corn, beans and manioc and another for cash crops such as cacao, pepper and papaya.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"But the power of the big landowners, combined with lack of capital and marketing problems for cash crops, were the downfall of many a small settler. Some were forced to become cowboys on the big facendas. Others were actually employed as pistoleiros, gunslingers, by the big landowners, invading smallholdings in the dead of night, killing settlers or evicting them by threatening murder. Many failed settlers ended up digging for gold at the vast Sera Pelada mine or in thousands of smaller mines.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"It has often been said that the soils of the Amazon are not really suitable for farming and that this is the cause of the failure of many settlers. Tropical soils are usually less fertile than the soils of the temperate zones. The main reason is the high metabolic rate of living beings in the moist tropical climate. In the rainforest, most trees drop a few leaves all the year round and as they reach the ground fungi, caterpillars or herbivores munch them up. Leaves are thus quickly converted back into plant food, which is then rapidly absorbed by the soil, to be used by the roots of trees and shrubs for new growth. Trees actually contain much of the fertility present in forests, and a thick layer of leaf mould never accumulates as it does in temperate forests. Thus tropical forest soils converted into farmland are usually deficient in humus, and settlers find it hard to use them for anything other than tree crops. The conversion of tropical forests into pasture is a particularly questionable enterprise. This becomes abundantly clear when one travels across the Amazon on the dirt roads that have been built since the sixties, as I have done for many months. There are now endless stretches of grassland dotted with the burnt-off remains of trees projecting starkly into the sky. Only very occasionally does one see a cow or, even more rarely, a buffalo. Usually the pastures are neatly fenced, but often the fences enclose scrubland which is neither pasture nor forest.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Half of the pastures established within the last twenty years or so in the Amazon are now abandoned. In fact, many have never actually seen a cow. Frequently, they were simply used by their owners to attract development subsidies and other kinds of financial support from the government. In twenty years from the 1970s onwards, the Brazilian government paid out no less than six billion dollars in such tax incentives to Brazilian landowners, much of it borrowed from foreign banks. In return, Brazil gained a largely unproductive area of so- called 'pastureland' in the Amazon, approximately the size of France. This astonishing waste of resources was for many years a cornerstone of Brazil's development policy. In addition to the devastation of the environment, other sectors of the Brazilian economy were starved of much-needed development capital.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The ruthless and senseless destruction of the Amazon forest throughout the 1970s and 1980s could not be kept a secret. Films and reports about the forest holocaust soon led to the formation of pressure groups in Europe and the USA, focusing on the environmental dangers of deforestation in the tropics. Researchers discovered that much of the money spent on 'developing' the region was paid out by the World Bank and other development banks which received their funds from taxpayers in Europe and North America. But few taxpayers were aware how their money was being spent.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Above all, it was road construction which paved the way for cattle ranching as well as mining projects. The BR 364, which was cut from Cuiaba in Mato Grosso through Rondonia towards Rio Branco, capital of Acre, was particularly contentious. The World Bank was forced to reconsider its investment policy when demonstrations in Washington led to enquiries in the US Congress. The bank had actually ignored its own environmentalists, who had warned of the consequences for the virgin forest of the construction of this road. It has since been paved and, although there are already plenty of new potholes, the road is here to stay, facilitating further destruction of the forest.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The Bom Futuro mine in the state of Rondonia is a case in point. A few years ago, rich deposits of tin ore were discovered in this location near Ariquemes on the BR 364. Wildcat miners started prospecting for the ore. The first few arrived on mules, kitted out only with picks, shovels, sacks and rudimentary refining equipment. When the rumour started spreading that there were rich pickings at Bom Futuro (the 'mine of the good future'), thousands followed. A road was bulldozed through the forest. It is a sad irony that the subsequent success of wildcat mines like Bom Futuro made long-established tin mines in places like Cornwall in southern England uncompetitive, forcing them to close. Bom Futuro mine is an astonishing vista. Out of the flowering forest emerges a cratered moon landscape dotted with tents made of black polythene sheets covered in red dust. There are smouldering trees everywhere. Just a few years ago, this was virgin forest. Now 25,000 people live here in their makeshift shelters, cutting holes into the ore-rich soil with their pickaxes and shovels. But, increasingly, the operation is being mechanized as the big companies move in. There are any number of Komatsu diggers and Mercedes-Benz lorries, digging up the ore and carting it to processing plants. The miners and truck drivers work around the clock and earn good money by Brazilian standards, but the devastation is appalling and the risks are high.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"There are puddles everywhere with swarms of mosquitoes. Just about everybody has malaria. The hospital in Ariquemes is the only one in the world that exclusively treats malaria cases. The hospital director explained why: 'The forest, as an organism, has a defence system. Its defence against devastation are enormous swarms of mosquitoes. We have nearly 300,000 cases of malaria annually. The devastation of the forest should be seen as a political issue.' While we are filming at the hospital, a lorry arrives carrying the corpse of a man who'd been battered to death: a miner who had died in a dispute over mining rights. He was one of about five people killed like that at Bom Futuro every week.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Life in the Amazon comes cheap, for settlers, miners, rubber tappers and Indians alike. In this world of conquest, the original inhabitants are the biggest losers. Road building in their territories invariably results in disease and violent death. Wherever the bulldozers roar through the forests, pushing over trees and levelling hills, Indians are on the retreat. In the past, up to 90 per cent of any given tribe would perish soon after contact. They have no immunity, or indeed traditional medicines, against diseases like measles, TB, whooping cough, polio, meningitis or just the common cold. Until the white man arrived, flu was unknown here. Now it is a killer disease.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Surui chief Itabera told us: 'We never had pneumonia, measles, malaria. When we lived in the jungle we were healthy. After the white man came we started getting sick. One-third of our people have tuberculosis now. That's why we sell our trees to the sawmiller. But he doesn't value us. He just exploits us and our forests.' The same story is told by Indians throughout the Amazon. And where the Indians have not died from disease, many have died from bullets.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"In another Amazon state, Para, we went to film the new town of Paragominas. It is located on another new road, the Brasilia-Belem highway. This place has been called the 'sawmill capital of the world'. There are some 500 mills, financed mainly with government grants. They slice up the thousands of trees brought every day along the web of dirt roads cut into the forests. A permanent smoke cloud hangs over the town from sawdust incinerators and charcoal kilns. Over forty species of trees are processed in the sawmills. As they are cut down in the forest, they tear down many other trees with them, because they are connected by a tangle of lianas. The degraded forest dries out much more than virgin forest, with the big trees no longer providing shade. Such forests are an easy prey for fires. Apart from providing high-quality timber cheaply, places like Paragominas also produce charcoal, the new boom industry in the Amazon. It is the sawmill off-cuts that are stacked into the charcoal kilns. The kilns are worked by resettlers from other parts of Brazil. Men and women earn around ten dollars a week, but the majority of the workforce are children. They earn little more than food money. One boy told us: 'I get up at one o'clock in the morning to work the whole day. We have no school, no nothing. We only suffer and work here. The charcoal won't let the children grow.

Brazil has run up a world-record debt \u2013 some 120 billion dollars \u2013 to set up new industries and new mining operations such as the Carajas mine. It is the richest source of iron ore in the world. Financed by loans from the EU, Japan and the USA, it provides the raw material for steel industries throughout the Western world. Our cars, fridges, washing machines, pipelines and iron girders are now made mostly from ore mined in Carajas, a mountain of iron first discovered when the compasses of planes flying over it went wild.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Brazil's state-owned mining company, Compania do Vale de Rio Doce, developed Carajas into a super-efficient operation.

The actual mine itself is not an ecological disaster area. In fact, the forests around the Carajas mine have been kept relatively intact. But several pig-iron smelters have now been established around the town of Maraba to the west and it is here that the forests are being incinerated. The trees burned in the kilns come into the equation at zero value, a tempting prospect. And thus the world's most unique flora is turned into profane charcoal to smelt iron ore. Brazil has been using money borrowed from our banks to destroy what is, arguably, its most precious natural asset, the Amazon forest, as though it were absolutely valueless. Thus rainforest trees end up providing us with our cars and washing machines.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Para is the easternmost state of the Brazilian Amazon. Apart from Rondonia, it is the most ravaged part of the Amazon forest. It is here that cattle ranching first started. And it is here that the largest mining operations are in place, not just for iron ore, but also for bauxite, manganese, copper and gold. It is in Para that huge areas of forest have been flooded by hydroelectric schemes, largest of all the Tucurui dam which powers Carajas and other mining operations. But it is also here that the resistance against further rainforest destruction has been fiercest.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"A new alliance between scientists, ecological activists and Indians has been forged with the purpose of slowing down and ending the destruction. It was a Brazilian professor, Dr Salati, who first pronounced that the continuing destruction of the eastern section of the Amazon forest could have the most severe climatic consequences. He showed that the rains that come in from the Atlantic first shed their moisture over the forests of Para. This rain is absorbed by the trees, but most of it is released again by evapo-transpiration powered by the hot tropical sun. The moisture rises from the steaming forests and blows westwards, where the clouds shed their load again and again. And so the process is repeated six or seven times until the clouds reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, where they are driven upwards by the cold mountain air. Some of them drift southwards, eventually to fall as rain over Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and even as far away as Europe. Others are blown northwards, to reach as far as Mexico and the wheat belts of the USA and Canada.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Scientists have expressed the fear that further deforestation of Para on the eastern rim of the Amazon forest would be disastrous. Already, there are signs that the rains are falling more erratically and that the dry season is getting longer. The local climate seems to be getting drier; the majestic Amazon clouds appear to be drifting by more and more often without shedding their rain. With ever more deforestation, average soil temperatures are rising as they have done elsewhere on the planet where trees have been cut down on a huge scale, as in Africa and India. At the same time, soil moisture is declining and when the rains do pour down there is much more rapid run-off than from land covered by the multi- layered canopy of trees. In deforested regions, soil erosion is severe, washing precious topsoil into the rivers and polluting waters that once teemed with fish.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"Dr James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia theory, is convinced of the critical importance of the Amazon forest for sustaining the beneficial interaction between the biosphere and the atmosphere.

In a recent lecture he stated:",l.a.createElement("br",null),"\u2018One way to value the forest as an air-conditioner would be to assess the annual energy cost of achieving the same amount of cooling mechanically. If the clouds made by the forests reduce the heat flux of sunlight received within their canopies, by only 1 per cent, then their cooling effect would require a refrigerator with a cooling power of fourteen kilowatts per acre. The energy needed, assuming complete efficiency and no capital outlay, would cost annually \xa32,000 per acre ...

The most astonishing manifestation of this new allegiance was an extraordinary gathering at the small town of Altamira in the state of Para. It was here that yet another massive hydroelectric dam had reached the planning stage. The dam would have flooded land traditionally inhabited by the Kayapo, the Arara, the Assurini and several other Amerindian tribes.

If the present rate of deforestation continues in the east, in the states of Para and Maranhiio, it could soon trigger a collapse in the whole system, perhaps before 30 or 40 per cent of the forest is cleared.' The Indian camp was in the grounds of a mission station outside the town, right on the edge of the forest. Young Kayapo warriors had built huts for their people from tree branches and palm leaves. There were Indians sleeping in hammocks, cooking fish, manioc arid bananas, mothers suckling their babies, their tiny faces painted red with the sap of urucum nuts.

The cattle ranchers had mustered the support of traders and settlers and they all shouted 'we want the dam, we want the dam'. They had been led to believe that dams mean progress and a better life. And Altamira certainly needs progress: everywhere there are holes in the roads, living conditions are atrocious and there are hardly any jobs to be had.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"But, in the meeting, scientists stated that big dams mean trouble. The Balbina dam, near Manaus, in particular, only recently completed, proved that point. There were millions of dead trees left standing in the water. A huge area of good land had been flooded, and there were now few fish. New diseases like leishmaniosis were spreading like wildfire. The turbines were corroded by the stinking, acidic water and they produced only a quarter of the electricity that had been anticipated.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"The Indians and the ecologists pointed out that progress does not have to mean giant dams and enormous forest fires.

One old Kayapo woman, Kokumi, took the microphone, an object she'd probably never seen before in her life, and said this to a hushed audience: 'Listen, white man, you have already got plenty of land, and we, the Indians, have only little left. These are our lands, our waters, our forests. Our food depends on the game animals and the resources of the forests and the rivers. I have already many grandchildren, and their health depends on these things.

Rubber tappers, too, use the forest without destroying it. Their struggle to prevent its further annihilation was highlighted as a result of the murder of rubber tappers' leader Chico Mendes in December 1988.

We have to fight for an end to the violence to ourselves and the forest. I think this is the movement's future: to spread across the whole of the Amazon region, with schools in extractive reserves that will be set up throughout; with health-care clinics and co-operatives to market the goods; with research centres where the people of the forest may develop new technologies, so that they can utilize the forest better without it being destroyed.'",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"To the astonishment of the forest people, the outgoing government of President Sarney decided in January 1990 to demarcate the first official extractive reserve in the state of Acre.
