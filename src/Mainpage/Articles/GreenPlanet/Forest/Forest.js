                    <p>
                    For over 40 years I have lived surrounded by trees, on a few acres on the edge of Tintern
                    Forest. As I write this, at the end of July, I am looking out at hazel, willow, cherry, apple,
                    pear and plum trees, and further away, a huge oak and a row of Douglas firs. A light breeze
                    is blowing, and a myriad of leaves are oscillating in the wind, safely attached to twigs and
                    branches. I can hear blackbirds and robins calling, not so urgently now since their fledglings
                    have left their nests. A pigeon is cooing in the distance.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    This is a world of both change and constancy. Some of the trees in this landscape have been
                    planted by us humans and others by birds, in a patchwork of forest and pastureland. Some
                    people think of forests of foreboding places, or even as places of menace. Well, I have never
                    felt that way, ever since I roamed woodlands as a child, as birds flitted across the green air,
                    as deer slipped silently by in the distance, as hares nibbled clumps of grass in forest
                    clearings. I have sought the safety of a forest world since I was little, and even then the
                    great, lacy canopy of trees conveyed a feeling of awe in me, as it still does today.

                <h4>A World Changes</h4>
                <p>
                Those of us who live in and around the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest don’t have to be
                told that these are areas of outstanding natural beauty. In a country that only has about 12
                percent forest cover they are truly special places. Why can’t much more of the land be
                covered in forest? Their benefits are obvious: they clean polluted air, absorb carbon dioxide,
                store and filtrate rain water, prevent soil erosion and supply wood for many uses. They
                teach us about life on earth. And they offer us wonderful spaces to roam.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Much of the Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest look like areas that have been largely
                unchanged since time immemorial. Not so. Over time, these landscapes have gone through
                an astonishing variety of adaptations.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The region has been inhabited for millennia, evidenced by remains of megalithic
                monuments, and ancient hill forts. The Romans arrived at around AD 50, attracted by a
                plentiful supply of timber, charcoal, iron ore, ochre and lime. The Anglo-Saxons carried on
                exploiting these precious resources. Then Normans and the thee Tudors used the forest as a
                hunting ground, whilst also exploiting the forest's fine timber as a ship building material.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                From the late 18th century onwards the forest became an industrial region, initially utilising
                charcoal for smelting the abundant iron ore. Oaks, beech, ash and hazel were coppiced for
                this purpose, which was a very resilient way of using forest resources as the trees always
                regrew from the stumps.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Then, in the 19 th century, coal started to be used for smelting the local iron ore instead, and
                deep coal mines and iron mines, as well as steel, tinplate works and foundries started to dot
                the landscape. Wood distillation works produced a range of chemicals, and all these
                enterprises were connected by a network of railways and tramroads. At the start of the 20 th
                century, competition from more suitable locations elsewhere in the UK gradually reduced
                industrial activity in the area. The locals were increasingly left to their own devices once
                more.
                </p>
                <div className="blackLine"></div>
                <h4>The Locals</h4>
                <p>
                The people of the forest have always played their part in any new commercial activity. They
                supplied the workforce for nobles and kings, and for forest, and mining and industrial
                enterprises, with only limited benefit to themselves. In addition to any monetary gain they
                subsisted on crops grown on smallholdings and cottages gardens.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The forest people are masters of a form of traditional permaculture: combining vegetable
                gardening with growing soft fruit and orchards, and planting edible hedges. Chicken and a
                pig or two to supplemented their family diet and produced manure. Some people still utilise
                the ancient privilege of grazing sheep in the forest and on the road verges. These are truly
                resilient ways of living.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Today, parts of the forest could be described as a model for ‘rewilding’, allowing landscapes
                to revert to their natural existence with only limited human interference. The wild boar now
                roaming the Forest of Dean again are a source of meat for some and a menace to other,
                particularly when they invade household gardens.

                <div className="blackLine"></div>
                <h4>Beauty and Ecology</h4>
                <p>
                In the local forests we can experience a living multi-story green landscape reminiscent of
                Britain’s ancient past. This kind of landscape is reflected in the vivid imagery of Celtic
                ornaments, in which trees and their branches and leaves are intertwined with all manner of
                forest animals. Perhaps this is a good way to convey in artistic images what one scientist
                recently called the ‘Wood Wide Web’.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The forests around us can literally speak for themselves. There are many layers of
                communication within an intact forest ecosystem that has grown organically over time. It is
                now well accepted that trees communicate via their root systems and also via the strands of
                fungi through which they are interconnected within the soil. Natural forests are living
                superorganisms that have a complex community life of their own.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We should never forget: forests covered much of the planet before humans invented
                farming and herding some 12,000 years ago. We humans have tended to be a menace to
                forests. With our chainsaws, bulldozers and tractors we are now better equipped at clearing
                forests than ever before, converting trees into window frames, into furniture, into toilet
                paper, into charcoal.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                If they could speak our language, forests would probably tell us that they would rather
                prefer a world without people. Given half a chance, forests are self-perpetuating places.
                They will always assure their continuity, as they drop their seeds in late summer, as they
                shed their leaves in the autumn. The synergy of many living organisms that depend on each
                other is astonishing to learn about, in the coexistence of a myriad of living beings.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                These days we read much about the plight of tropical rainforests. Here in the UK places such
                as the Forest of Dean could be called rainforests, too. When we walk in the forest on a rainy
                day, we may realise that the mist that permeates the forest is an essential part of the forest
                ecosystem. The moisture that is given off by the trees also keeps the forest alive, and keeps
                our human communities supplied with water.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                You may say that life is not all about coexistence and cooperation, but that competition is
                the name of the overarching principle of life on earth– the survival of the fittest and all that.
                Well when you walk in the forest you certainly see evidence of that, too. You see trees that
                have died because they have not grown as fast their neighbours and been shaded out by the
                bigger trees. But maintaining the continuity of life in its interdependent totality is
                increasingly seen as the key underlying principle of resilient ecological systems.

                <h4>Today and Tomorrow</h4>
                <p>
                Today, of course, the forest has become a favoured destination for visitors and holiday
                makers with their SUVs and camper vans, coming over from cities such as Bristol and
                Gloucester. Cyclists love criss-crossing the green landscape where every turn of the wheel
                offers a different view.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                For city people, reconnecting with the natural environment and its amazing sights, sounds,
                and textures can bring a deep sense of relaxation so absent from city life. The term forest
                bathing – deep immersion in the life of the forest – has become part of the vocabulary of
                visitors and holiday makers.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And for the forest people, life keeps changing again and again. City people have moved in,
                buying run-down cottages as a refuge from stressful city life and to bring up families. Some
                newcomers are welcomed by the locals, others are seen as arrogant intruders.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                What will the future look like? In the coming years more and more people will turn up
                driving electric cars and bikes. Local resilience will be greatly augmented by the use of
                renewable energy. Many cottages now feature solar panels, and more wind turbines will
                make their appearance on the edge of the forest, contributing to the coffers of local
                communities.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                What is the environmental future of our forests? One concern is the looming issue of
                climate change. As the world gets warmer, will the vegetation that has grown here for time
                immemorial still be suitable? Will oak, beech, ash and lime be able to cope with an ever-
                warming climate?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                One thing is clear. With so many changes having occurred over time, landscapes such as the
                Forest of Dean and Tintern Forest have continued regardless. Ways of live come and go, but,
                one way or another, continuity prevails. We owe it to future generations that they will have
                a forest world to enjoy and benefit from as we have.
