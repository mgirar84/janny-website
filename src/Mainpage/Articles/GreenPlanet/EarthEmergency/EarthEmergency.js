                    <p>An acute State of Emergency exists on Earth, imperilling its climate, its life support systems
                    and the lives of billions of people. The related crises of environmental degradation and the
                    destitution of a third of humanity are linked to the ever-greater concentration of economic
                    and financial power, and worsened by a profound failure of world governance. The world
                    community is called to act, agreeing a planetary ethic – deep respect for all life and for
                    human dignity – as expressed in the Earth Charter.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Billions of people worldwide are becoming aware of the connectedness of all life, including
                    human life. Collaborating through our global and local networks, we can accelerate
                    initiatives already under way, shifting the global balance of power in favour of restoring
                    biodiversity, sharing the Earth’s resources equitably, and assuring the sustainable wellbeing
                    of present and future generations.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    To achieve these aims, we call for a new global alliance. The creativity of all of humanity is
                    needed – using traditional and popular knowledge, art, design, engineering, modern science
                    and business to help create a thriving and regenerative relationship between people and
                    planet.</p>
                    
                </div>
                <p>At this defining moment in history, we urge world leaders to acknowledge the Earth’s State
                of Emergency, and give priority to major investments in environmental security, green
                economies, and peace, not war. We call for the coming decade to be used to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create ecological economies, compatible with the Earth’s ecosystems –
                        acknowledging that perpetual economic growth is impossible in a finite world, and
                        that the hidden, unpaid costs of current economic practices are fully accounted for.    
                    </li>
                        <br></br>
                    <li>Rapidly phase in efficient, renewable energy technology in place of polluting energy
                        systems as a key strategy for repowering industry, transport and the built
                        environment.
                    </li>
                        <br></br>
                    <li>Shift taxation from labour to the use of resources, pollution and waste – promoting
                        conservation and circular, clean production systems, and enhancing social welfare
                        and jobs.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Co-operate globally to revive local democracies and economies – prioritising local
                        production for local consumption, minimizing the need for long-distance transport of
                        goods.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Make regenerative agriculture the global norm – securing food supplies with minimal
                        environmental impacts, avoiding GMO crop technology and prohibiting patents on
                        life.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Protect tribal and traditional societies and their lands – respecting their important
                        contribution to human knowledge and their right to decide their own future
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Fundamentally reform worldwide financial systems to assure that money is
                        generated and used for the benefit of all rather than self-interested minorities
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Initiate a progressive shift of funds from military spending towards environmental
                        security – providing adequate water, nutrition, healthcare, shelter and sustainable
                        livelihoods for all
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Create a participative Earth Democracy – fundamentally reforming global
                        governance, for the benefit of people and nature, so that international decision
                        making is open and accountable within the framework of a strengthened and
                        democratised United Nations.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Acknowledge that all our actions need to ensure the well-being of future generations
                        as an essential prerequisite of any decision-making processes.
                        Jointly, we can work to restore the earth’s ecosystems and soils, feed the world and create
                        liveable and sustainable human settlements. Another world is possible, let us make it
                        happen.
