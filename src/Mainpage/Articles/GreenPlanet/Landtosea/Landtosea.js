                    Recently I had a conversation with a well-known nutritionist. I casually said: ‘of course, we
                    are what we eat, aren’t we’? She looked at me rather disparagingly and said: ‘No, no,
                    wrong: We are what we assimilate’. She went on to talk about how the health of the
                    internal flora of our digestion system determines how well we absorb the food we eat.
                    Well absorbed nutrients help the body to form the cells which constitute the immune
                    system and to assure a healthy organism. Poor digestive function means poor assimilation,
                    chronically low energy levels, poor immune responses and an ever-diminishing level of
                    stamina and vitality.

                    </div>
                    <p>In the 21 st century humanity is eating more food from larger areas of farmland than ever
                    before in our history, and this is determined by both our numbers, our meat-centric diet and
                    our global food trading systems. Our collective food consumption patterns have become the
                    main interface between ourselves and the world’s soils. If food is badly assimilated by us the
                    impacts of a relentlessly urbanising humanity on our home planet are likely to become ever
                    more severe.</p>
                    <p>
                    While we individually are affected by what we assimilate what we eat, the world’s soils and
                    ecosystems are, above all else, affected by what we eliminate from our bodies, our
                    households, or from entire cities. We use resources without much concern about their
                    origin or the destination of our wastes: inputs and outputs are considered to be largely
                    unconnected. Nutrients are removed from farmland and not returned to it. Forests are
                    logged but often not replanted. Fossil fuels are prised out of rock strata, refined and burned,
                    causing air pollution and climate change. Raw materials are extracted and made into
                    consumer goods and end up polluting living nature.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Apart from the food we eat, we also need to reflect on how it is sold to us, invariably
                    wrapped in plastic. The careless use and irresponsible disposal of plastics has recently been
                    widely reported. Every day there is more news about plastic waste littering the world’s
                    beaches and oceans, and more harrowing pictures of marine wildlife starved or entangled
                    by plastic detritus. Back in the early 1960s one could find few bits of plastics on American
                    and European beaches. But that was then. Today over 12 million tonnes of plastic bottles,
                    bags, food wrappers, microbeads and fishing nets pollute the oceans each year, a truck load
                    every minute. Much of what we eliminate cannot be assimilated by nature.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Many people have responded, no longer willing to turn a blind eye. All over the world you
                    can now see beach cleaning parties. Inventors have come up with devices to collect up
                    plastic debris with booms, or to gobble them up with suction devices. But as the consumer
                    revolution hits Asia and Africa, the plastics tide is swelling to unprecedented proportions,
                    drifting in ocean currents and even clogging beaches of uninhabited islands or accumulating
                    in Arctic ice. All in all, the world’s response so far has been woefully inadequate to the scale
                    and severity of the problem.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    This vividly illustrates probably a profound, systemic problem with modern civilisation: it is
                    an essentially linear system. Much of what we eliminate cannot be assimilated by the
                    world’s ecosystems. Yet we should ask Nature to be our teacher: the natural world is an
                    essentially circular system and invariably turns its waste products into nutrients for new
                    growth: every output by an organism renews the living environment. This is demonstrated
                    most visibly and vividly as leaves fall onto the forest floor in the autumn and become leaf
                    mould and soil by the complex interactions of many forms of ‘life in earth’.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The organic movement, of course, has understood this. It has set itself the task of protecting
                    and enhancing soil life, as well as human well-being. It is also increasingly concerned itself
                    with trying to counter climate change via soil carbon storage and reforestation. This is very
                    timely indeed, as droughts, storms and extreme floods have been increasing across the
                    world in both frequency and severity.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    We urgently need to accelerate safe, healthy food systems that enhance ‘life in earth’ as
                    well as life on earth. Agroecological practices, such as permaculture and agroforestry, are
                    showing the way. And, of course, we must make sure to eat better quality food, to minimise
                    food wastage and to move towards eliminating plastic food packaging.
                </p>
                <h4>Closing the circle</h4>
                <p>
                As we face ever greater impacts on the environment it seems important to go back to first
                principles. In his book The Closing Circle, 1971, American ecologist Barry Commoner defined
                four laws of ecology which have stood the test of time:
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Everything is connected to everything else. There is one ecosphere for all living
                        organisms and what affects one affects all.</li>
                        <br></br>
                    <li>Everything must go somewhere. There is no ‘waste’ in nature and there is no ‘away’
                        to which it can be thrown.</li>
                        <br></br>
                    <li>Nature knows best. The absence of a particular substance from nature is often a sign
                        that it is incompatible with the chemistry of life.</li>
                        <br></br>
                    <li>Nothing comes from nothing. Exploitation of nature always carries ecological costs
                        and these costs are significant.</li>
                </ol>
                <br></br>
                In this context, the concept of sustainability may no longer suffice as a frame of reference
                for our actions. It is no longer good enough to just try and sustain soils, forests and
                watercourses in a profoundly degraded condition – we need to take active measures to
                regenerate them instead. In this context, it is most important to address the relationship
                between farming and cities as the world’s primary food consumers. Organic, regenerative
                farming is, above all else, about closing the loop between food production, nutrient supply
                and soil life.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Lack of concern about this is vividly demonstrated by the deplorable condition of many river
                estuaries, and not just regarding the ubiquitous presence of plastics debris: all over the
                world estuaries have become dead zones, due to excessive nitrogen and phosphorus
                pollution. This is a systemic problem: Urban sewage is not recycled, and farmland is kept
                productive artificially by the use of chemical fertilisers. Across the world there are now
                some 500 dead zones where marine life has perished due to depleted oxygen levels:
                nutrient run-off from chemical agriculture combines with urban sewage and causes the
                growth of algae which sink to the bottom and use up oxygen when they decompose.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The world’s largest dead zone – in the Gulf of Mexico – covers 27,000 square miles in the
                summer months. The reason? The Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of US: surplus
                fertiliser from the farmland of 31 states, plus waste water from some 12 million city people.
                1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen are discharged into the Gulf every year, causing
                eutrophication and the death of oxygen producing marine ecosystems!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Closer to home, much of the Baltic is another vast dead zone for the same reason. Whilst
                the surrounding countries have agreed an Action Plan to reduce nutrients loads, so far there
                has been little improvement in the condition of the Baltic.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In Britain we used to have a major problem with eutrophication in the Thames estuary, but
                incineration of much of London’s domestic sewage has reduced this problem. But, of course,
                this does not address the fact that the nutrients it contains are not returned to farmland as
                fertiliser.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Closing the circle between urban food consumers and the farms that produce this food
                through regenerative practices is an, as yet, unresolved issue. Contamination of sewage
                with heavy metals, chemicals and medicines has caused the EU to prohibit the use of
                sewage as fertiliser. It is argued that this pollution problem can only be solved if domestic
                waste water is collected and treated separately from industrial waste, and only then used in
                agriculture.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In some regions, such as South Australia, these issues have been vigorously addressed: the
                region is heading for 100% reuse of waste water in urban fringe farming. Viticulture, market
                gardens and agroforestry projects now utilise both recycled sewage and urban green waste
                compost. Soils in the Adelaide Plain have been regenerated, and more carbon is
                sequestered from the atmosphere at the same time.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                This example could be copied if Britain were to adopt its own waste water reuse standards
                in a post-Brexit world. An additional dimension of this issue is that the world&#39;s phosphorus
                deposits are being depleted at an alarming rate. At current consumption levels, we will run
                out of known phosphorus reserves by around 2100, but meanwhile consumption can only
                increase further under the pressure of ever increasing global food demands.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We can no longer afford to waste precious mineral resources in linear systems of resource
                use. Regenerating the vitality of soils and ecosystems is crucial in an urbanising, climate-
                challenged world heading for ever greater food challenges. We need to give nature a chance
                to beneficially assimilate human wastes, and to help initiate innovative policy changes to
                deal with these vital matters.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Regenerative development is about giving back as well as taking – maintaining a proactive
                relationship between humanity and the world’s ecosystems, and nurturing nature’s
                dynamism and abundance whilst drawing on its income. Again: we need to help regenerate

                soils, forests and watercourses that our cities depend on, rather than just accepting that
                they are ‘sustained’ in a degraded condition.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Dealing with the environmental implications of an urbanising world is a new challenge for
                humanity and this requires the evolution of a new consciousness, linking the wellbeing of
                individual citizens with humanity’s collective interest in the health of our home planet.
