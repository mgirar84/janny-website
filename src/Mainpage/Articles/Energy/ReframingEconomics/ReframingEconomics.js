                <h3>Reframing economics after Covid 19</h3>
                <p>This text was written in 2020 for the Club of Rome’s ‘Reframing Economics’
                Initiative.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The impacts of Covid-19 have left humanity reeling, as a viral contagion has also become
                        an economic contagion, destabilising the economies of countries across the world.
                        Meanwhile spiraling government debt, rising wealth and income inequality, and
                        ecological decay prevail.</p>
                        <p>Much of economic growth across the world has effectively become un-economic
                        growth: resource depletion, pollution and climate change inevitably undermine the
                        prospects of future generations. And with hundreds of millions of people still in grinding
                        poverty, prevailing economic theory and practices are clearly failing much of humanity.</p>
                        <p>The planetary emergency we face is due in large part to a concentration of economic
                        and financial power. The world’s businesses, left to their own devices, can’t be trusted
                        to deliver a sustainable world. A resurgence of strong regional, national and global
                        governance is needed, prioritising fiscal incentives towards sustainable practices.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Restoring the Earth’s living, organic economy should be at the heart of any recovery;
                make/ use/ dispose economics should be replaced by a circular, regenerative economy;
                local economies should be strengthened and made more resilient. More and more
                people see the need for a global green recovery, with economics firmly embedded
                within sound ecological parameters, whilst also offering a wide range of new
                employment options</p>
                <p>Specifically, we see the need for the following key steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Beyond GDP</h4>
                        <p>Across the world GDP is used as a measure of national financial well-being, but it is
                        hugely misleading: For instance, the cost of fighting Covid-19 would be regarded as a
                        contribution to GDP rather than a vast expense funded by government borrowing. The
                        challenge now is for societies to agree a comprehensive alternative indicator that
                        reflects national well-being in all its dimensions, measuring true wealth, health and
                        quality of life, as well as resource depletion, and the impacts of pollution and climate
                        change.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>A circular, regenerative economy</h4>
                        <p>Perpetual economic growth is impossible on a finite planet. When the unpaid costs of
                        current practices are factored in, much of economic practice becomes profoundly
                        uneconomic. All too often, private gains become public costs. Bringing about a
                        regenerative, circular economy, minimising human pressure on nature, avoiding waste,
                        stimulating innovation and opening new job opportunities must be given urgent priority.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Planetary health and human well-being</h4>
                        <p>On a finite planet, the need for dynamic but stable interactions between human and
                        natural systems need to be embedded in economic theory and practice. Given that
                        destruction of biodiversity appears to create ‘favourable’ conditions for new diseases to
                        arise, the linkages between human health and planetary health must surely become
                        embedded in economic policy. A holistic approach to health provision is urgently called
                        for, transcending the often-narrow focus of national health services.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Regenerative farming</h4>
                        <p>Industrialisation and urbanisation have separated humans from the soil that feeds us. In
                        many places, family farms have given way to vast food factories. Unacceptable
                        treatment of farm animals and overreliance on meat-based diets have become the
                        global norm. New approaches are urgently needed: Safeguarding long-term soil fertility
                        by well-maintained carbon and nutrient cycles is becoming an urgent priority. Policies
                        for stimulating regenerative agriculture and healthy soils are a prerequisite for long-
                        term food security.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Mainstreaming efficient renewable energy</h4>
                        <p>The global climate emergency requires us to rapidly wean ourselves off fossil fuels. In
                        recent years, efficient, renewable energy technologies have become cost competitive
                        with polluting energy systems, even as the price of oil and gas collapses. To further
                        speed up innovation, a shift of subsidies from fossil fuels towards renewable energy is
                        urgently needed. Main-streaming renewables is a historic opportunity for putting
                        manufacturing, transport and the built environment on a sustainable energy footing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Towards carbon positive living</h4>
                        <p>The climate crisis has induced a profound sense of insecurity in millions. It requires
                        responses beyond the actions tentatively agreed by the world’s governments. Above all
                        else, we need well-resourced global initiatives to secure the biological storage of billions
                        of tonnes of carbon by protecting and regenerating soils, and forest and marine
                        ecosystems. More than ever, this is not just an issue for public policy, but also for
                        individual action.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Reviving local economies</h4>
                        <p>Globalisation has devalued community living, yet local cooperation leads to community
                        resilience, and is a powerful way to cope with crisis situations. There is now
                        unprecedented scope for co-operating globally to revive local economies – prioritising
                        local production for local consumption, and minimizing the need for production based
                        on long-distance transport.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Less trade in products, more exchange of ideas</h4>
                        <p>In recent decades, global trade has expanded as never before. But its fragility is
                        becoming increasingly apparent, as expressed in frequent supply line interruptions in
                        global, just-in-time manufacturing. Furthermore, global relations are still marred by
                        extreme divergence between rich and poor. As the routine global trade in products
                        comes increasingly under question, could there be a new emphasis on a global exchange
                        of ideas instead?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Finance for good</h4>
                        <p>For too long, money has been our master, not our servant. Faced with an
                        unprecedented fragility of global financial systems, new agreements are needed to
                        assure that money is generated and used for the benefit of all. In a planetary
                        emergency, we also need a profound shift of expenditure from military towards
                        environmental security – prioritising adequate water, nutrition, healthcare, shelter, and
                        existential human wellbeing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Consumption: from efficiency to sufficiency</h4>
                        <p>Limits to growth also means limits to individual consumption. The steady flow of
                        resources and products from the poorer to the richer countries has major environmental
                        and social consequences. Living under Covid-19 lock-down has encouraged many of us
                        to go back to basics. What is sufficiency? How can we assure a better distribution of
                        resources across the world, whilst defining suitable limits to the fulfilment of human
                        needs?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Creating regenerative cities</h4>
                        <p>We are building an urban future, with cities at the heart of national economies, yet
                        rampant, increasingly global urban resource demands are threatening the very future of
                        humanity and the natural world. The bulk of the world’s resources are used in cites, with
                        little concern about associated externalities. A new understanding of the economic
                        metabolism of cities is required to assure that their resource demands and waste
                        discharges don’t undermine nature’s regenerative capacity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Tax shifting</h4>
                        <p>A taxation system which rewards ‘goods’ and penalises ‘bads’ is long overdue, aiming to
                        facilitate an efficient, regenerative, high-employment economy sustained by prudent
                        use of natural capital. Specifically, taxation needs to progressively shift from labour to
                        resource use, countering pollution and waste, and promoting efficient production
                        methods.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The speed of innovation</h4>
                        <p>We live in the age of the unprecedented science-driven acceleration of innovation, often
                        driven by commercial interests. Technology is in danger of running away with itself. But
                        increasingly the question is: who are the main beneficiaries, who controls the
                        development and uses of technology. Can technological progress be a servant to
                        humanity, rather than our master?
                        It is a primary concern for the Club of Rome, and its long-standing ‘trade-mark’ focus on
                        Limits to Growth, to help re-educate academia, politics and business towards a new
                        regenerative economics for a sustainable world, with all the implications summarised in
                        this document.</p>
