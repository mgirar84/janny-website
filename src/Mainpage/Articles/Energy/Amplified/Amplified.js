                    The other day I walked around the Science Museum in South Kensington, looking at steam
                    engines, historical motor cars, flying machines and underwater exploration vessels. I saw a
                    young father, carrying his baby child in his arms who was standing in front of a space capsule in
                    which two Americans had returned from the moon back to earth. 'Look', he said to the child, 'you
                    will fly in one of these one day when you're big. I can fly through the air, but you will fly through
                    space, between planets and moons, and think of nothing of it. And here on earth you will travel
                    in rocket cars, have bulldozers to dig with and have computers to do your thinking for you. You
                    will see through camera lenses and telescopes and microscopes. You will talk through
                    microphones and listen through earphones. Your voice will be heard through loudspeakers and
                    your image will appear on video screens. And you will think nothing of it'.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The child was soundly sleeping his arms. He looked embarrassed when he noticed me listening
                    to him and walked off into the next room to bring more blessings of science and technology
                    upon himself and his child. And he left me brooding about the meaning of it all.

                <p>
                I sat down in a cubicle to watch documentary film about an industrial robot that was drawing an
                image of the first steam locomotive with his metal hand onto a large sheet of paper,
                manipulating a magic marker. It turned into a precise drawing of the machine. The few
                seemingly uncontrolled movements of the mechanical arm gave it a sympathetic air of
                imperfection. But then, industrial robots are not normally used to draw pictures. Their robust
                hands are designed to manipulate laser torches or large spanners.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The machines of the first industrial revolution were designed to multiply muscle power (steam
                engine, petrol and diesel engine, electric motor). The second industrial revolution in the middle
                of the 20th century introduced devices that extended the human nervous system (radio,
                telephone, film, TV). And now the third industrial revolution, or micro-revolution, introduces
                devices that amplify the human brain (computers, data stores, monitors).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We still come in the physical guise of our hunter gatherer ancestors, but as regards our impact
                on this planet we've become altogether different creatures. The brainy ape has become a
                technological giant. And there seems to be no limit to the appetite of the amplified man: A seam
                of coal for breakfast, the trainload of iron or for lunch, a freighter full of bauxite for dessert, and a
                square mile of forest for supper, washed down with a tanker load of oil.
                </p>
                <h4>Man and Robot</h4>
                <p>
                Recently I saw a TV programme about a robot factory in Japan. It was a far cry from a pottery
                shed or metal workshop of times past. During normal working hours the human workers were
                doing maintenance on numerically controlled machine tools, supplying them with the parts
                required for the automatic production of robots. At 6 o'clock, when the workers went home, the
                strip lights were switched off in the factory and the robots continued making robots in the dark:
                machines making machines, and only a few red and green control lamps were still glowing in
                the electric factory.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                These robots are supposed to be our new servants. They are more easily programmed than
                workers. They don't strike for better working conditions or more pay. They don't need canteens
                to feed them, or houses to live in, or schools for their children. They can work day and night in
                their own angular, electric world. Yes, they break down sometimes, but they don't get sick pay,
                and neither does their ‘employer' have to make contributions towards their old age pensions.
                A sufficient supply of electricity and materials is all that is needed to keep the robots going.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                There is no doubt that as we get used to the ever-widening range of services provided by
                robots, we will come to depend on them. They will become part of the world of the amplified
                man like the steam engine or the electric motor have done before. It is true that robots will do
                some very unpleasant jobs that people shouldn't do, like doing repair work in nuclear power
                stations or operating in factories polluted with poisonous gases. But then, do we really need
                nuclear power stations, or do we want to use lethal chemicals in our productive processes?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Industrialists and some trade unionists may agree that robots are useful in manufacture
                because they increase productivity and help us to compete in the world market. Industrialists
                aim to benefit from reduced payrolls by boosting profits, and trade unionists may benefit from
                shorter working hours. And the new leisure industries are keen to pounce on anybody who's got
                a bit of new spare time on their hands. But: what are the wider consequences of the ever-
                increasing amplification of man? Is it leading to progressive dehumanisation? Are we becoming
                the servants of the machines that were meant to free us from toil and drudgery?
                </p>
                <h4>Human Identity</h4>
                <p>
                An important aspect of our increasing amplification is the loss of human identity, as we become
                a fusion of man and machine. The machines we use, directly or indirectly, are part of our being.
                They become tools for fulfilling desires which we soon take for granted: 'Where should we go on
                holiday this year, Greece or Portugal or Thailand?' The question how we’d get to that holiday
                destination is barely discussed anymore: Of course, by plane! Aeroplane, train, motorcar, and
                all the many other means of transport or production, are now part of our identity. They are
                meant to benefit us, but they are also part of our ever-greater planetary impact.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And what about the places where we have come to live? The proverbial visitor from outer space
                would be profoundly puzzled by cities like New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Tokyo. They
                would probably take them for colonies of giant crystals that have grown out of the earth with
                irresistible force. Are they habitats for us humans or are we only miniature parasites of these
                gigantic crystalline structures: Man servicing a world of enormous quartz and silicon crystals?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The artefacts we produce in our factories have become an essential aspect of our human
                identity. We have come to rely on them and they have become part of the internal geography of
                our minds. They shape our attitudes to the world, and they increasingly determine our actions
                and reactions to it. Not so long ago, when someone wanted to dig a ditch, they would have
                thought of using a shovel as the appropriate tool. Now a mechanical digger would come to mind
                as the ‘natural' option, the right machine for the job. And thus the mechanical digger has
                displaced the shovel as part of the new identity of the amplified man.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When we stand in front of a mirror to look at ourselves, we only see a tiny proportion of our true
                amplified selves. We only see the biological part without the huge technical appendix that has
                come to determine our identities. Thus we have become truly larger-than-life. But there is a
                snag: the loss of certainty about who we have become is not easing the age-old question as to
                what we are here for. And the amplification of the individual is rapidly coming into conflict with
                the well-being and continuity of humanity.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The amplified man considers himself as master of the natural world. Nature out there has
                become a somewhat exotic museum piece, to be preserved on videotape and in photographs –
                a stage prop in the ever-evolving drama of modern civilisation: Forests have been degraded to
                pulp mines; agriculture has been proclaimed an industry among other industries, just another
                factor of production; plants and animals are being measured up simply in terms of their potential
                yield of proteins and carbohydrates.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Quantity of consumption has become the yardstick of the hierarchy of the amplified man. The
                most powerful individuals or nations gobble the most. They are constantly expanding their
                economic, political and military power, and everybody else is busy trying to catch up.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                So what does the amplified man actually look like? We've seen that he is part man, part
                machine. His tentacles stretch around the world. His breath is carbon dioxide as well as sulphur
                dioxide and all the other waste gases he emits from his smokestacks and exhaust pipes. He has
                human hands for pressing buttons and handling knives and forks, for operating gear levers and
                steering columns. And he's got metal hands to operate the tools that make the things he has
                come to depend on. He has a brain, a heart and sexual organs that are still riddled with the
                remnants of 'primitive’, human emotions. And he has microchips grafted onto his nervous
                system, empowering to satisfy his ever-greater ambitions.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                'The endless cycle of idea and action,
                <br></br>
                Endless invention, endless experiment,
                <br></br>
                Brings knowledge of motion but not silence,
                <br></br>
                knowledge of words, and ignorance of the word,
                <br></br>
                All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,
                <br></br>
                all our ignorance brings us nearer to death,
                <br></br>
                but nearness to death no nearer to God.'
                <br></br>

                </p>
                <h4>Expansion and conquest</h4>
                <p>
                The modern amplified man is the greatest expansionist the world has ever seen, developing
                ever newer ways in which to exert his power. His predecessor came on horseback, with
                gleaming swords and suits of armour. Then he conquered with sailing ships and bronze canons.
                Then he kitted himself out with gunboats – steamship against dugout canoe, machine gun
                against bow and arrow. Then he asserted himself with jet planes and missiles. When
                domination through military force became less viable, he expanded his power by use of
                communication satellites and novel global trading systems. Manipulation of commodity and
                currency markets have become his latest instrument of economic and political control.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Wherever his tentacles reach, he leaves trails of broken traditional cultures, their values
                smashed, their human relationships in tatters. The heroes of his brightly coloured moving
                pictures, projected on cinema and television screens across this planet, are everywhere
                displacing the heroes of treasured stories that have been passed on from generation to
                generation.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The amplified man has an insatiable appetite for power. It arises out of an insatiable quest for
                victory in competition, any competition. A fist fight or a tennis match. A talent competition or a
                stock-market takeover bid. A battle for market share or the nuclear arms race.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But in this quest for expansion and conquest, the amplified man has acquired weaponry that
                could well make him and his children the very victims of his ultimate victory. Mutually assured
                annihilation is the maxim of the nuclear arms race he is engaged in with an opponent who is his
                equal. And yet, how can one pf them prove their superiority without unleashing this final war?
                And herein lies the ultimate perversity of his all-pervasive quest for ever greater power.
                </p>
                <h4>Return to Life</h4>
                <p>
                It is not surprising that the children of the amplified man are getting anxious about survival. They
                are getting restless because the promised land of automation offers them no role, and little
                reason for living. They are becoming angry about the blandness of the angular spaces which
                they are being made to inhabit. They are getting suspicious of the electronic conjuring tricks of
                advertising, the mirage of fast cars and super clothes which they cannot afford to buy. They do
                not accept their own redundancy, or the redundancy of life on earth.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The amplified man has implanted himself in all of us to some extent, but we are increasingly in
                conflict within ourselves. We are tempted by the comforts and power we are offered, and yet we
                are appalled by the ruthlessness of attempts for our whole being to be taken over. And whilst we
                are creatures of our time, we will not accept that time is going to run out on us.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The amplified man calls his children darlings one moment and hooligans with the next breath.
                Because he can't seem to love, he distracts them with an ever-greater array of gadgets, and as
                they grow up, he finds ever newer ways of grafting them onto his machines. But his children are
                getting restless, and many now refuse to participate in his games, seeking fulfilment in human
                relationships instead. They have started to listen to people who have not forgotten their
                'primitive' humanity. They want to learn from people who still know how to listen to their heart,
                who still know how to use their hands to make things, and still use their feet for walking.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Many young people have rediscovered the value and beauty of life, and have adopted life itself
                as a revered teacher. They are sickened by the onslaught on nature in the name of economic
                and technological progress, and they don't want any part in the life-denying wargames of the
                amplified man. They will not be subservient to the infernal machines that he is using to conquer
                life. And they will not tolerate the isolation that results from unbridled mechanisation.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                People’s yearning for a meaningful and non-destructive life is becoming a major challenge to
                the amplified man. Many of us would rather be ‘old-fashioned’ centaurs or fauns or mermaids,
                humans fused with animal beings, rather than being grafted onto machines in the image of the
                amplified man. This refusal to cooperate with him and his schemes coincides with the deep
                yearning for cooperation with each other, living in a society in which mutual aid and love and
                respect for other beings becomes essential to our behaviour.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                By any standards, our impacts on our home planet are utterly disproportionate to our physical
                size, and even our numbers. Since to some degree we are all part of the onslaught on it, it is up
                at us all to do something about it. Can the David within us have a word with the Goliath that
                resides in us all and tell him that things can't go on the way they have done in recent years and
                decades? Human destiny is not for sale to the highest bidder, regardless as to what he intends
                to do with it. And neither is the destiny of the planet. If Goliath refuses to listen, must David pick
                up the stone and throw it at him? And what would be the consequences?
