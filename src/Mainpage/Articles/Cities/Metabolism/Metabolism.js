                    <p> Ancient Rome, at the height of its power, obtained much of the grain needed to feed its citizens
                        from North Africa. As its own farmland grew tired, and as ever more farmers were turned into
                        soldiers, the insatiable appetite of the metropolis could be met only with foodstuffs grown further
                        and further afield. North Africa became Rome’s primary supplier of grain, olives and wine.
                        Freight ships criss-crossed the Mediterranean laden with produce from its colonies.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        The role of North Africa as Rome's breadbasket had profound implications in ecological terms:
                        1) as the region’s forests were turned to farmland, there was a massive loss of tree cover with
                        erosion and other consequences which are still felt today. 2) the export of grain to Rome was
                        also an export of plant nutrients, or soil fertility, never to be returned. The soil fertility of much of
                        North Africa was shoved through the stomachs of the Romans into the Mediterranean Sea.

                Rome, before its eventual decline, reached a population of about one million people. At the time
                it was by far the largest – and most powerful – city in the world. It set patterns of urbanisation
                still resonating today. Now, 2000 years later, nearly half the world's five billion people live in
                cities. Never before has urban growth been as rapid as it is now. Everywhere small farmers are
                leaving – or forced to leave – the land in search of urban livelihoods. Usually relatively self-
                reliant peasants or herdsman, with traditions of caring for the land that they have inhabited for
                millennia, are being turned into consumers of cash crops as they adopt an urban lifestyle.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We all need food every day, but every meal we eat represents an export of plant nutrients from
                the land where it came from, never to be returned. And where does the waste go? Well into the
                sea eventually. This one-way transport of soil fertility, first practised on a large scale by Rome,
                has now reached global proportions. There are hundreds of dead zones in the estuaries of
                rivers across the world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the 19th century, when London grew by leaps and bounds, the sewage accumulating in the
                Thames became a huge challenge. The problem was ‘solved’ by building an extensive drainage
                system – out of sight, out of mind. The sewage was, largely, dumped in the Channel, and not
                put back on the land. In order to keep the farmland feeding London fertile, guano – bird
                droppings – were used instead. They were shipped to the UK all the way from Chile.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When the guano threatened to run out, scientists started to develop artificial fertilisers. Never
                mind recycling sewage, they reasoned, we can supply mineral fertilisers – nitrate, phosphate,
                potash – in bags. Subsequently sewage systems in cities all over the world have been designed
                and constructed as disposal rather than recycling systems. Disposal, not recovery, became the
                brief of sewage engineers. Thus much of the fertility of the world's farmland that feeds the
                teeming billions in cities ends up in the rivers and in the sea.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And because sewage is considered a nuisance, not an asset, it may as well be mixed with
                whatever else needs to be flushed out – cleaning fluids, disinfectants, chlorinated hydrocarbons,
                heavy metals, and all the other poisons we discharge routinely from our households and
                factories. The Romans didn't do that, but we do. And add a few million gallons of oil every year
                and you end up with the kind of potent brew that fish have to cope with in coastal waters all over
                the world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And then, add fertilisers – nitrates, phosphates and potash – from farmland, of which about half
                is not absorbed by the food plants but leached into groundwater, and then washed out by
                streams and rivers into the sea. And then add slurry from factory farms, much of it originally
                imported as animal feed from distant land – another one-way transport of plant nutrients from
                farmland to the sea.

                <h4>Liquid and Solid Wastes</h4>
                <p>
                Ever since the 1960s there has been growing concern about the eutrophication of lakes in
                heavily urbanised regions of Europe and the US: that is loss of oxygen in surface waters as a
                result of overfeeding them with plant nutrients. The dire condition of Lake Erie, in particular,
                made headlines. Since then the problem has not gone away, though the condition of some
                lakes has been improved by the installation of more sophisticated sewage works and
                oxygenation systems.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the 1980s there is growing concern about the condition of coastal waters. Landlocked seas,
                in particular, such as the Baltic and the Adriatic, are a real worry. Next on the list is the North
                Sea where eutrophication now occurs every summer in places such as the German Byte. A
                proliferation of algae is caused oversupply of plant nutrients from sewage, fertilisers and slurry
                run-off. The algae act like a sort of poison bait to the fish because of the ever more varied
                cocktail of toxins with which they are laced. They are heavily implicated in the rapid increase in
                fish diseases that have been observed in coastal waters in recent years.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Modern cities have a much more complex metabolism than their ancient predecessors such as
                Babylon, Carthage, Athens or indeed, Rome. Their environmental impact was largely confined
                to forests (extraction of timber and firewood), soil (export of nutrients, erosion and salinisation)
                and water (long range aqueducts). But archaeologists won't find any plastics, toxic wastes or
                radioactive substances in any ancient rubbish dumps they examine.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In contrast, every inhabitant of the modern Western city, with urbanisation rates of up to 80
                percent, generates around two tonnes of rubbish per year: one tonne of domestic refuse and
                one tonne of factory waste from the industrial products we purchase. Future archaeologists,
                investigating the waste dumps of modern cities, will be astonished at the sheer volume and
                variety of artefacts, as well as the bizarre mixture of materials that we saw fit to use and to
                dispose of.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Urban and industrial rubbish dumps, piled up over recent decades, pose an environmental
                problem whose scale is, as yet, inadequately understood. It is becoming quite apparent now
                that even ‘ordinary’ domestic rubbish is far from harmless. The impacts range from seepage of
                potentially toxic liquids such as disinfectants, wood preservatives, cleaning fluids, used motor oil
                and left-over medicines, to corrosion of discarded batteries, and to plastics residue. And waste
                dumps invariably give off toxic fumes as they catch fire, which they often do.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Factory wastes, an essential ingredient of our consumer lifestyle, are often deposited in the
                same dumps as household rubbish and greatly add to their pollution potential. In one part of the
                United States, in New Jersey, where the content of waste dumps is being investigated closely,
                hundreds of mixed waste dumps have been found to leach all manner of potent poisons into the
                groundwater. In Germany and Britain similar problems have been unearthed.
                </p>
                <h4>The Age of Fire</h4>
                <p>
                Air pollution, too, is predominantly a problem of modern urban/industrial society. Coalmining,
                when it got into full swing in the 19th century, made available unprecedented quantities of
                carbon compounds for the purposes of combustion. As fire was tamed into motion power, it
                came to replace muscle power in most heavy duty-applications, such as traction, transport,
                manufacturing and farming.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Perhaps the most significant environmental impact of our urban/industrial civilisation is the
                large-scale transfer of carbon from geological deposits into the atmosphere, in the form of
                carbon dioxide. By the late 1980s, the CO2 content of the year had increased from the previous
                265 to 345 ppm, or by 30 percent, going up by 1.5 ppm every year. This doesn't sound that
                much but few atmospheric scientists now doubt the reality of the greenhouse effect and its
                likely, dramatic global environmental impacts in the 21st
                century.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But right now it is the other by-products of combustion which are the most immediate cause for
                concern: notably sulphur and nitrogen oxides.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the 1980s it became increasingly clear that air pollution was by no means a problem of the
                past as had been assumed after the worst urban smogs had been tackled by clean air
                legislation that had been passed Britain and elsewhere. Fires in individual households had been
                replaced by remote power stations with tall stacks fitted with dust filters, and this was thought to
                be the solution to the air pollution problems of the industrialised countries. But not so: By the
                early 1980s the horror stories of dying trees were beginning to hit deadlines, from Germany, to
                Poland to Czechoslovakia. Most European countries reported serious damage to forests, with
                the statistics showing a further decline every year.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Sulphur dioxide from power station and factory chimneys, as well as nitrogen oxides from these
                chimneys and from car exhaust pipes, were implicated as the main culprits. In addition, some
                3000 new man-made gases in trace quantities were identified as part of the cocktail of
                pollutants in the air we all breathe. All living beings in the northern hemisphere are now exposed
                to these waste gases to varying degrees.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Throughout the industrialised countries millions were spent researching the chemistry of trace
                gases, their reactions with each other, their persistence in the atmosphere, and their impact on
                the sensitive tissue of living matter. A further environmental problem was the erosion of the
                ozone layer right at the top of the atmosphere by gases such as CFCs used in various industrial
                applications. All of these are ingredients of the urban, convenience-oriented lifestyle which we
                have come to take for granted.
                </p>
                <h4>Closing the Circle</h4>
                <p>
                The metabolism of modern cities as manifested at present – its throughput of foodstuffs, forest
                products, fossil fuels and mineral resources – is demonstrably disruptive of the planet's life
                support systems. Nevertheless, global urban-industrial development is accelerating as never
                before. Less environmentally destructive traditional lifestyles, based on long established
                sustainable practices of farming and renewable energy use, are everywhere under attack.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But fortunately, growing minorities of urban people are becoming increasingly aware of the
                boomerang effect of our modern lifestyles. It is becoming apparent that we are on a collision
                course with all the life support systems of our home planet. It is becoming clear that all our
                futures are at stake, and self-interest is kicking in as a powerful motivating force for change.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The process of urbanisation and industrial development is likely o continue across the world, but
                how can its destructiveness be curtailed?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The most profound problem we are up against lies in the linearity of the development processes
                we are engaged in. Nutrients are taken from the land as food is grown, never to be returned.
                Trees are felled for building materials or pulp, and all too often forests are not replenished. Raw
                materials are extracted and processed into consumer goods which end up as rubbish which
                can’t be beneficially reabsorbed into living nature. Fossil fuels are extracted from rock strata,
                refined and burnt and thus released into the atmosphere. All in all, our present civilisation is
                vastly accelerating the process of entropy with, as yet, hardly imagined consequences for the
                future of life on earth.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                To undo the damage already done, and indeed, to prevent further ravages, a great leap of the
                imagination, and a profound act of collective willpower is called for. For some years, the ecology
                movement has done much to draw attention to the issues at stake and few people can claim
                ‘that we didn't know’.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Cities are for people and it is all of us who have to realise that our future, or more precisely that
                of our children, is in jeopardy. To make cities and urban living ecologically viable is thus
                becoming an utmost priority. All living beings are profoundly engaged in securing the future of
                their offspring, and it is time that an urban humanity does the same.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The slogan of the 'greening of the cities' has been catching on in recent years, but all too often it
                is meant mainly to create more green spaces, i.e., to improve the look of the urban fabric. It is of
                course important to create a pleasant, greener, urban environment for people to live in. But that
                can only be the start.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It will be crucially important to fundamentally reorganise the metabolism of cities – the
                throughput of raw materials, energy, consumer goods and the treatment of wastes – from the
                perspective of long-term ecological viability. We cannot afford to continue with a pattern of linear
                input and output which makes the routine generation of poisonous wastes a 'normal' activity.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                This is not the place to go into technical or organisational detail as regards the reorganisation of
                the urban metabolism. But there's no doubt that a move from a linear to a circular urban
                metabolism is one of the greatest challenges of the modern era.
