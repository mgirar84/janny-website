                    <p> Humanity is engaged in an attempt to build prosperous economies across the world,
                        yet current economic practices are threatening the very future of humanity and the
                        natural world. In the face of a looming earth emergency, can new thinking lead us to
                        new practices?

                        To address the deteriorating condition of our home planet in the Anthropocene, there
                        is an emerging consensus that we need to think towards ‘regenerative’ practices: It is
                        not sufficient to try and just sustain the global environment in an increasingly
                        depleted and polluted condition. The world is a dynamic and ever-changing place:
                        Our own bodies replace their 100 trillion cells every seven years or so. Life is
                        continuously renewed through the action of great variety of interconnected forces.
                        Could modern economies operate in a similarly regenerative manner?

                <p>
                    The term ‘regenerative’ is being used in an ever-greater variety of contexts:
                    regenerative farming, development, design, nutrition, medicine, economies. I have
                    written a lot about creating regenerative cities and moving towards circular
                    economies. Such perspectives are now being articulated in many places, but
                    meanwhile the essentially degenerative impact of our economic activities on the
                    world’s living systems continues.

                    <br></br>
                    It is astonishing that current accounting practices still do not factor environmental
                    externalities into national balance sheets. Governments and companies still tend to
                    see the destruction of Nature and resource depletion as an inevitable price of
                    progress, refusing to quantify inconvenient externalities in the price of products. Few
                    policy makers have been willing to adopt green accounting models to assure a
                    commitment to maintaining and regenerating natural capital.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    With an ever-increasing understanding of the planetary crisis we are facing, we have
                    to urgently address this fundamental systems problem. Can we overcome the
                    selective blindness which allows us to live with the status quo? Can we detach
                    ourselves from a seemingly irreversible entropic, degenerative, linear, downward
                    spiral? How can a regenerative approach prevail?
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The crucial issue of environmental externalities has been discussed for decades, but
                    with only gradual progress being made to deal with it. It is becoming apparent that if
                    externalities are directly experienced at the local level, there is a good chance that
                    they will eventually be addressed, particularly where people’s health is at stake.
                    Relevant examples are effective measures that have been taken to deal with effects
                    of smoking, asbestos pollution and contaminated drinking water.

                    <br></br>
                    At the wider, national level economists have attempted to quantify the ecological
                    costs of economic activity since the 1980s. In a pioneering study in 1986, economist
                    Lutz Wicke costed the environmental damage caused by the West German economy
                    at 6% of the country’s gross national product. To deal with this damage he
                    recommended a comprehensive ecological tax reform to help stimulate the
                    emergence of a regenerative economy. But most of these recommendations remain
                    on the shelf while many systemic environmental problems remain stubbornly
                    unsolved.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Climate change, of course is a global systemic externality of an urban-industrial
                    civilisation relying on vast annual inputs of fossil fuel energy. Yet the world
                    community still refrains from adopting correct price signals by methods such as cap-
                    and-trade permits or by direct regulation, sufficient to internalize negative
                    externalities. But, alas, the very rapid decrease in the costs of regenerative energy
                    systems such a solar, wind and energy storage technologies is coming to the rescue.
                    Initially stimulated by feed-in tariffs in Europe and Australia, regenerative energy
                    technologies are increasingly self-funding as they become cost-competitive with
                    fossil fuel-based energy technologies.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    But even 100% adoption of renewable energy technologies will barely stabilise
                    global carbon concentrations. Meanwhile the challenge is to stimulate the
                    greenhouse gas absorption capacity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. But whilst
                    we discharge ever more C02 into the atmosphere, the capacity of the biosphere to
                    absorb it is being significantly reduced at the same time. From 1990 to 2015, natural
                    forests declined from 4.28 billion to 3.99 billion ha, a loss of 290 million ha. Planted
                    forests increased by 167 to 277 million ha. This may help to meet global timber
                    demand, which is expected to triple by 2050, but it is not nearly enough to stabilise
                    terrestrial carbon emissions. Large scale regeneration of both forest ecosystems and
                    farmland soils is urgently needed to make a significant impact.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Another key, underreported systemic crisis we face is river water contamination
                    caused by the twin problems of cities not returning the nutrients contained in urban
                    sewage back to farmland. Meanwhile farmers are forced to replace these lost crop
                    nutrients by applying artificial fertiliser to their fields instead, with substantial
                    quantities leaching away into rivers. As a result, there are now some 500 dead zones
                    in the world&#39;s oceans. Add the fact that we are likely to face phosphate fertiliser
                    supply shortages in the coming decades, and it is clear how important it would be to
                    close this particular circle through the introduction of regenerative sewage
                    technologies.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Now another global crisis is receiving much publicity: pollution of the oceans with
                    plastic detritus is becoming a problem on a similar scale to climate change, but so far
                    there is little action on the horizon to deal with it. It is becoming evident that this
                    problem can only be solved by intercepting plastic waste before it enters the marine
                    environment: Applying innovative recycling technologies that turn plastics – a long-
                    lived material that is briefly used in short-term packaging – into long-lived products,
                    such as building materials, bollards, decking, fence posts and garden furniture. But,
                    again, the right price signals are required to make this possible.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    These three systemic crises can only be addressed by implementing various aspects
                    of regenerative development. Moving from linear to circular systems, as advocated
                    by the Ellen McArthur Foundation, has both biological and technical components:

                    <h3>Circularity of living systems</h3>
                    Perhaps the greatest challenge facing us is to turn modern economies and urban
                    systems from linear into circular modes. Nature operates as an essentially circular
                    system and invariably all its waste products become sources of new growth: every
                    output by an organism is also an input which renews the living environment. Can we
                    organise our economies to fit this model?
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Pavan Sukhdev, president of WWF, argues that we need to overcome the problem
                    of the economic invisibility of Nature. To align economic and ecological systems it is
                    crucially important to understand that the value of ecosystems services is vast, and
                    probably more than double the value of the global economy, as estimated by
                    ecological economist Robert Constanza.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>   
                    The concept of regenerative development, first and foremost, has to be anchored in
                    a clear understanding of the integral and interdependent nature of living systems,
                    with the sun powering all life processes on Earth. Creating regenerative economies
                    means, above all else, to do everything possible to stimulate the regenerative
                    capacity of nature by deliberate policies and incentives.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Crucially, we need to develop a comprehensive new understanding of the non-
                    entropy of living systems: According to quantum physicist Erwin Schroedinger: “Life
                    seems to be orderly and lawful behaviour of matter, not based exclusively on its
                    tendency to go over from order to disorder, but based partly on existing order that is
                    kept up … We must be prepared to find a new type of physical law prevailing in it. …
                    From all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to
                    find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics.”
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Similarly, according to the inventor of the concept of general systems theory, Ludwig
                    von Bertalanffy, “the conventional formulations of physics are, in principle,
                    inapplicable to the living organism being open systems having a steady state. We
                    may well suspect that many characteristics of living systems which are paradoxical in
                    view of the laws of physics are a consequence of this fact.”
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Under the right conditions, biological resources will always tend to renew
                    themselves, and the inherent regenerative capacity of natural capital, such as
                    forests, soils and aquatic ecosystems, is evident for all to see. The case for creating
                    regenerative systems of resource use on land and in aquatic environments, as
                    essential components of modern economies, is evident. We must surely try and do
                    everything we can to assure that soils, forests and watercourses are enabled to
                    continuously regenerate themselves. And specifically, in the case of farming, organic
                    farming, or regenerative farming, should become the norm rather than the exception,
                    driven by appropriate policies.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3>Circular technical systems?</h3>
                    Modern economies need to be organised to mimic natural systems. But what does
                    this mean for the technical systems on which so much of the wealth and comfort of
                    modern civilisation are based? There is a marked difference between the circularity
                    of biological systems as compared with the challenges facing technical systems. Our
                    industrial economies are subject to the second law of thermodynamics: the use of
                    fossil energy, their key ingredient, is an irreversible process. As we power technical
                    processes, usable energy is irretrievably lost as unusable, dispersed waste. As
                    energy is made to do ‘useful work’ for us, it inevitably ends up as pollution or
                    disorder.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Modern urbanisation, intimately connected to economic development, is a major
                    contributor to this process. Cities are giant heat engines: the energy they require for
                    their many vital functions can be used only once, as fuels are converted into low
                    grade heat and waste gases. And as raw materials are processed, their quality also
                    inevitably deteriorates. Order, established in the form of urban settlements, causes
                    disorder elsewhere in Nature as products are imported, utilised and discarded.
                    Concentrating or ordering human activities in high-energy modern cities will tend to
                    contribute to disorder, waste and pollution. The vast, global ecological footprints of
                    cities are a case in point.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Between them, modern cities, and the economies they harbour, are ‘entropy
                    accelerators’ – they downgrade the resources they require in the process of using
                    them. A key challenge, then, is to find ways to replace high-entropy systems with
                    low-entropy systems instead. This makes it all the more important to make
                    renewable energy systems our main sources of energy in the very near future.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Technical systems do not have the inherent capacity to renew themselves in the
                    same way as biological systems. This is where human inventiveness comes into
                    play: The waste management mantra of refusing, reducing and recycling, of course,
                    has been on the green agenda for decades. But there are systemic problems with
                    this: much recycling is actually downcycling. A loss of quality is inevitable and major
                    energy inputs are required to power it. Nevertheless, recycling and remanufacturing
                    of technical products is an important part of a regenerative, green economy.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Again, this is vividly illustrated by the case of waste plastics. In industrialised
                    countries, urgent action on redesigning packaging, reducing, recovering and
                    stabilising the markets for recycled plastics through mandatory recycled content is
                    paramount. All countries need to curb the use of single-use plastics, and to prevent
                    stray plastics from ending up in waterways and the oceans beyond. The critical issue
                    is to divert a long-lived material into long-term uses. After a brief use in packaging,
                    plastics can be ‘put to rest’ in products that they are most suited to: as construction
                    materials or even in road surfaces. The benefits are all too evident: Cleaner
                    environments and the creation of a regenerative, green economy. China, as a
                    booming industrial economy with vast pollution problems, is now beginning to make
                    significant headway in this direction. Will other countries follow?

                    <h3>Regeneration for sustainability</h3>
                    “Nature does not set out to be sustainable but achieves it because it is regenerative.
                    If the economic system is to prosper long term, it must operate like nature;
                    regeneratively,” said the authors of A finer future is possible, a report to the Club of
                    Rome, published in 2016.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In my own work, urban systems – as the primary location of economic activities –
                    have been the central theme. As thinker in residence in Adelaide in 2003 I argued
                    that a vigorous move towards regenerative development could greatly stimulate
                    South Australia’s economy. The economic reasons for this are evident: a city region
                    that takes active measures to improve the efficiency of its use of resource also
                    reduces its reliance on imported resources – it re-localises parts of its energy and
                    food economy and brings a substantial part of it back home. These concepts
                    became the basis for a wide range of new policy initiatives by the government of
                    South Australia. Today South Australia, a region of 1.8 million people, is a world
                    leader in solar and wind energy, battery storage of electricity, solar-electric transport,
                    organic waste recycling and composting, waste-water irrigation, urban-fringe organic
                    farming and reforestation, etc.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In my view the wording ‘Regenerative economies for a sustainable world’ is a simple
                    and effective formula. Regenerative economies are the process and a sustainable
                    world would be the outcome to strive for. This wording includes the confident use of
                    the term sustainability, despite some of the baggage now associated with it. Without
                    constant renewal and regeneration there can be no sustainability.
