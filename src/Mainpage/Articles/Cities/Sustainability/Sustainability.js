                    <p>For 25 years, sustainable development has been held up as the solution to the world's
                    problems. But instead we have had ever more pollution, biodiversity loss and climat
                    change. The concept of sustainability has been abused like few other terms in history. It is
                    time to think not just about sustaining the world's badly damaged ecosystems and human
                    communities, but about regenerating them instead.

                    Sustainable development (SD) has been a global orthodoxy ever since it was agreed as a
                    guiding principle for collective human action in the runup to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The
                    official definition is well known: "Sustainable development … meets the needs of the
                    present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
                    Effectively, it was a marriage of convenience to facilitate north-south collaboration on
                    enhancing human livelihoods while also halting humanity's deteriorating relationship with
                    its host planet.

                    <br></br>
                    SD is a concept to which few people would object; most of us would agree that we should
                    not live as if there were no tomorrow. But the term has become like a rubber band that can
                    be stretched almost at will in many directions.

                <div className="blackLine"></div>
                <p>In the past 25 years, only lip-service has been paid to SD, particularly around the use of fossil
                    fuels. During that time, all economic and urban development across the world has been
                    driven by the ever-greater use of coal, oil and gas. And yet, the very use of fossil fuels is
                    inherently unsustainable as they are a finite resource, and their combustion is the
                    predominant contributor to climate change.

                    <br></br>
                    In any case, how long is sustainable: 10 years, 100 years, 1,000 years? And who and what
                    should be sustainable: households, cities, whole nations, the world economy? And who
                    should benefit: current generations or all humans who will ever be alive? And where is the
                    critique of the current economic system: can SD really occur under the rules of capitalism,
                    where the refusal to put a price on nature's services and on ecological and social
                    externalities is a systemic problem?
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In my view, we need to start thinking of regenerative rather than just sustainable
                    development. We urgently need to take specific measures to help regenerate soils, forests
                    and watercourses rather than just allowing them to be sustained in an increasingly
                    degraded condition as we have done for many years. We have the knowledge and the
                    technologies to make renewable energy our main energy sources. And we urgently need to
                    regenerate local communities and economies that have fallen by the wayside as economic
                    globalisation has become a dominant force.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    It follows that only a systemic, rather than a vague compromise approach to future
                    development will suffice, starting with the realisation that development cannot be at the
                    expense of the health of the world's ecosystems and that their protection and continuous
                    regeneration must be a guiding principle for human action. It is high time that these
                    realisations were embedded in the teaching of economic theory at universities and business
                    schools all over the world.
                    <br></br>

                    An acute state of emergency exists on Earth, imperiling its climate, its life support systems
                    and the lives of billions of people. Could we create a better conceptual framework to assure
                    a plausible future for people and planet?
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The concept of regenerative development aims to fill this gap: it means that we need to
                    develop comprehensive rules for an environmentally enhancing, restorative relationship
                    between humanity and the ecosystems from which we draw resources for our sustenance.
                    In my own work, I have concentrated primarily on the metabolism of cities, examining urban
                    resource consumption and waste disposal patterns. In an urbanising world, the bulk of
                    human impacts on the biosphere are from urban production and consumption. Cities are
                    the primary location of national economic activities. Modern cities are also defined by their
                    dependence on the use of energy, with the bulk of the world's fossil being burned to power
                    urban systems. Urban energy consumption and global climate change are intimately
                    connected.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Much damage has been done to the world's ecosystems already, and urgent solutions need
                    to be found to reverse it. The time has come for cities to take specific measures to help
                    regenerate soils, forests and watercourses rather than just sustaining them in a degraded
                    condition, and to make renewable energy their main sources of energy supply.
                    Creating a circular rather than a linear urban metabolism – giving plant nutrients back to
                    nature, storing carbon in soils and forests, reviving urban agriculture, powering human
                    settlements efficiently by renewable energy, reconnecting cities to the regional hinterland –
                    these measures are the basis for creating viable new urban economies which are so badly
                    needed in this time of financial and economic crisis.
                    Regenerative development is as much about an honest give-and-take between humans and
                    nature as about reviving human communities at the local level. It is a concept that matches
                    closely with the ideas of EF Schumacher, author of Small is Beautiful, in whose name the
                    upcoming Schumacher Lectures are being held.
