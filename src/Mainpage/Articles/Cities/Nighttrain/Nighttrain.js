                    Shanghai Railway Station is a place like no other. The whole of the population of this vast city seems
                    to want to travel at the same time. And not just people, but people with bundles and packages the
                    size of people, queuing up at ticket counters, squeezing through turnstiles, with grandma and
                    grandchild in tow.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Just where is the platform I am looking for, and where is the train that will take me to Xi’an? There
                    are so many parts to this station and the Chinese characters on the signs are a riddle. After much
                    trial and error I find the train I have been looking for, but locating my compartment is a challenge
                    that is almost beyond me. Eventually, gesture language and a few words from my electronic
                    dictionary do the trick, and a helpful conductor shows me the way to the compartment where I have
                    booked a bunk. Hello! A young girl with a pleasant moon face will be my companion on this journey.
                    We won’t be able to talk a lot, but we can smile. She offers me exotic looking homemade biscuits
                    and I respond by giving her pieces of chocolate that I have in my bag.

                This is called a night train, but right now it is still afternoon. The train starts with a judder and it sets
                out on its journey out of the bowels Shanghai. I could have caught a plane but I have chosen to go by
                train because I want to see some of what has been happening to this city and this country since I was
                last here ten years ago. And as the train slowly creeps through the city, I catch glimpses of what has
                been happening. Millions of people have come here to live in the sky. They have arrived here by the
                millions from villages somewhere else to move into high rise apartment. They operate cranes, drive
                trucks, sweep the streets, drive taxis, aiming to earn some yuans for their families back home and to
                become consumers of Chinese-made goods. And they keep coming.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                There is little evidence now of the farms in the city that one could see just a decade ago. Concrete is
                the new normal, the soil out of which Shanghai grew over the centuries is just a platform now, on
                which to erect blocks of flat and office buildings, flyovers and factories. And then there are the
                power stations and their vast concrete cooling tower. And there are factories and more factories,
                with row upon row of shiny new cars parked outside, ready to find a buyer. Well, this is just a
                modern city, isn’t it, but what a city – London is just a little town by comparison. Nobody really
                knows whether it is 20 or even 25 million people who live here now. But this not an American city
                either – there aren’t really any suburbs with family homes and space for a lawn and a garage for two
                or three cars.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The train to Xi’an is not in a hurry. Maybe the driver gets tired ever so often and needs a rest. We
                keep being overtaken by the whoosh of sleek white trains that look like planes without wings. They
                purposefully glide by carrying business people and party officials who have better things to do than
                park in railway sidings. But going slow, of course, you can see, you don’t just scan the world you are
                travelling through.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We are rolling through a city that does not seem to know where to stop as it stretches into a
                landscape where forty story apartment buildings are the norm. Thousands of them. A concrete
                forest plugged into tarmac and flyovers, and every so often a tired looking river and a pond where
                carp are kept for the restaurants of Shanghai. Some greenhouses here and there, some little parks
                and playgrounds, too.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                My companion is getting bored and stretches out to sleep. I get hungry and go in the restaurant car.
                I am able to convey somehow that a plate full of rice and veg would not come amiss. My neighbour
                has a better chopstick technique than I do, but somehow I manage to get the food from plate to
                mouth to stomach. Yes, out there I can see some rice paddies now among them apartment buildings
                but they are much sparser than I remember. Greenhouses, yes, a lot of veggies are still grown
                around the city, the Chinese like their stir fry fresh and not wilted – better to grow them close by.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We have travelled two hours, and innumerable high rise blocks are still rising into the hazy sky, thin
                pencil-like structures with lifts instead of corridors. This is truly vertical living, not like the pavements
                full of chatter and children’s play back home in the village. China has come a long way, from village
                to mega city, from tending goats on steep hill sides to living high in the sky, from growing crops by
                hand to making toys and kettles for Wal-Mart and Tesco somewhere across the ocean. China is
                making things for the world to make things happen at home. Mao’s vision of a village future is a
                distant memory in this ultimate of developing countries.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Just over a hundred years ago the world as a whole had as many people as China has today. This is
                an issue that I brood on as the night draws in. But back then people had only just started burning
                coal and gas and oil, and building cities to chew up the world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                My companion has woken up again. She is keen to practice the few words of English she speaks.
                ‘Have you family’ she asks and I explain that I do. ‘Have you children?’ Again I say that I do. ‘How
                many children’, she asks as she looks down at her belly and I suddenly realise that she is pregnant.
                She looks at me and says, ‘I … only one.’ It takes me a moment or two to realise what she means … in
                China most people will only ever have one child. She is gently rubbing her belly greeting the child she
                is carrying inside.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Outside in the corridor mums and dads are walking up and down, queuing up to give their kids a
                wash, ready for bed in the confines of the sleeper. A boy is clutching his dad’s mobile to watch one
                last cartoon. Dad doesn’t have to think of a story to tell him and can have a chat with his neighbour
                in the compartment instead. Darkness spreads its wings across the land of China as our train
                continues its night journey.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Next morning we are in a different land. Small towns and farms, fields of maize and crops I haven’t
                seen before. An abundance of young trees, planted by directive of the communist party central
                committee. China has done a tremendous amount in recent years to reforest denuded land, to hold
                the soil in place, to supply fruit and nuts and even to create new Panda habitats. Liling, she say that
                is her name, tries to talk to me again. ‘I have new house, in Xi’an. I live 38 th floor high rise. Can see all
                the country from there, mountains and river. Have new kitchen, buying new sofa next week. Have
                already got baby bed.’
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The train keeps shuddering to a halt, and then speeding again, well, maybe 100 km per hour. No sign
                now of the fast trains we saw closer to Shanghai. We can see farmers tending their orchards, they
                have wrapped each individual apple in a plastic bag, right there on the branches of the trees. They
                sell their perfect apples on stalls by the road side, beautiful ripe fruit, apples and pomegranates. I
                wish I could buy a bag or two.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                As we turn a corner some huge buildings suddenly spring into view, dozens of them, some already
                completed, others still with cranes hovering above them. Vast concrete structures, each will
                probably accommodate 1000 people or more. It seems that in China there is little concern about
                whether high rise living is a good idea or not. That is how most people are going to live, period. Each
                building comes with its own electricity supply, air conditioning system, rubbish shoots, nurseries and
                cafes. If you have more money than average you may live in a little house of your own somewhere in
                the suburbs, maybe even an SUV in the garage, but don’t bet on it.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                ‘Here, that is house where I live, up there, see.’ Liling points to one among thousands of windows
                nearly at the top of a huge building. ‘My mother coming for visit tomorrow. So happy.’
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Xian unfolds in front of our eyes, as we glide through vast fields of wheat and corn and more
                orchards. As we pull into Xi’an’s railway station and it is time to say goodbyes, I ask Liling whether
                she has given ‘the only one’ a name as yet. She smiles and says, just ‘happy future’ and she explains
                that this could be the name for a boy or a girl. I make my way to the hotel I have booked, and within
                a couple of hours I catch a taxi to the terracotta warriors, the reason that most visitors undertake
                the journey to Xi’an. It is a long trek through traffic jams on elevated motorways past more high rise
                buildings and many buildings sporting the Chinese flag. I read that Xi’an has more people than
                London. The city is all new, and so are the cars crowding the streets.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But, of course, the warriors are anything but new, over 2000 years old, and only discovered by
                farmers digging for water some 40 years ago. They have become one of the great emblems of
                modern China. A whole new town has sprung up around the warrior exhibit. Every Chinese seems to
                wants to make the pilgrimage at least once in their lives. And there, under the cover of massive
                roofs, the clay soldiers guarding the tomb of emperor Qin Shi Huang stand lined up, hundreds of
                them. It is a magnificent sight and in addition to the soldiers, a few terracotta horses have also been
                dug up intact.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But what a difference between an ancient terracotta army and modern China. No horses here, but
                innumerable cars on brand new streets. This is a new world, one that even the last great emperor,
                Mao Tse Tung, could not have envisaged. Think about it: Today China has about the same population
                as the whole world just a century ago, 1.3 billion people. And each Chinese today has vast quantities
                of coal and oil fuelled energy at their disposal, six times as much as they would have had a century
                ago. China now releases more carbon dioxide than any other country in the world. The
                transformation is total.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The current Chinese government has proclaimed that it is now working towards an ecological
                society, but can that mean a future where every one of the tens of thousands of high rise building
                requires a continuous electricity supply to assure that the lifts in all those buildings keep working? I
                wonder what all this means for the future.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I leave China with more questions than answers. The country is on a high like few others have ever
                been before. The people look confident and one sees a lot of smiles on their faces. Liling is looking
                forward to a healthy child, and a happy to them both. But as China grows into a giant, with India,
                Vietnam and Indonesia close behind, wanting their share of the spoils, can the living planet cope?
                This needs to be a future for all the world, and I can only hope that it will be a happy one.
