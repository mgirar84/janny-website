                    <p>We now live in the age of the city, with well over
                        50 per cent of the global human population
                        being urban, and this figure is expected
                        to reach 68 per cent by 2050.
                        1
                        Cities are inherently
                        dependent systems, as their functioning relies on
                        supplies of a large variety of resources from beyond
                        their built-up territory, most notably food, water and
                        wood products. The linkages between cities, soils
                        and ecosystems have morphed over the centuries,
                        depending on levels of technological development
                        and cultural practices. Most notably, the geographical
                        range of their consumption patterns has expanded,
                        from largely local to increasingly global arrangements.

                    Current urban impacts on the global environment need
                    to be better understood if we are to make progress
                    towards a sustainable world. The central contradiction
                    we currently face is this: humanity is building an
                    urban future, yet urbanisation in its current form
                    is threatening the very future of humanity and the
                    natural world. With ever-larger numbers of people
                    living in cities that are ever-more resource hungry, we
                    are risking the long-term chances of human wellbeing
                    and even survival. What positive initiatives can we
                    take to address such fundamental systemic problems?

                <h4>Small Area, Growing Footprint</h4>
                <p>Modern cities, with their large human populations,
                    occupy a relatively small surface area: today some 4 billion people live on just 3–4 per cent of
                    the world’s land surface. This can arguably result
                    in some sustainability benefits, particularly with
                    regard to transport efficiencies. But as they grow
                    into preeminent centres of national economies and
                    of popular consumerism, cities develop ever-larger
                    global ecological footprints. In developing countries,
                    as villages and small towns grow into large cities,
                    their per-capita resource consumption can increase
                    three to four times due to increased incomes and the
                    ready availability of fossil fuels and manufactured
                    products. This has huge implications: in the process
                    of urban growth, cities develop increasingly global
                    tendrils for supporting their resource demands.
                    Urbanisation, as practised today, thus becomes a
                    feature of the ever-greater impact of humanity on
                    the biosphere.
                </p>
                <p>A fundamental systems problem of the modern city is
                    its essentially linear metabolism: resources are taken
                    from nature in huge quantities, embedded in products
                    that are used by consumers and then discarded as
                    waste in the natural world. Ecosystems have become
                    the sinks in which we dispose of our poisons and other
                    technical and chemical wastes that cause havoc in
                    nature. For an urbanising world to have a long-term
                    future, cities need to develop a circular metabolism,
                    as suggested in Figure 1. This change, of course, has
                    to be driven by appropriate policy measures.

                <p className="figureText">Figure 1. Modern cities have an essentially linear metabolism, taking resources from nature and dumping gaseous,
                liquid and solid waste into the biosphere. For a long-term sustainable future, cities have to learn to mimic the circular,
                regenerative processes that define natural systems. (© Herbert Girardet)

                <h4>Three Phases of Urban Evolution</h4>
                <p>It seems useful to develop some theoretical concepts
                of the character of urban systems. I have summarised
                their development with respect to their resource
                dependencies into three distinct phases.2</p>
                <p>Agropolis. The traditional town, in the absence of
                well-developed transport links, had essentially agrarian
                roots. Energy supply, and resource use and reuse, were
                necessarily localised. The town was reliant on crop and
                livestock farming systems that were peripheral to the
                settlement (see Figure 2).</p>
                <p>This model required a well-developed understanding
                of the conditions for sustainable interaction with
                supporting natural systems, such as soil husbandry,
                crop cultivation, the uses of farm animals, and water
                management. Of necessity it was based on an inherently
                circular metabolic arrangement: long-term viability
                necessitated that organic waste from within the city,
                with its associated nutrient and carbon content, was
                returned for productive use in the surrounding land.</p>
                <p>Petropolis. The modern city, in contrast, represents a
                different urban reality. It is powered for all its functions by non-renewable fossil fuels, and food and other essential
                resources are brought in from remote locations rather
                than from places peripheral to the city. Its fundamental
                existential dependence on daily petrochemical
                inputs (to resource supply, manufacturing and
                transport) results in a problematic relationship to the
                world’s ecosystems. So the existence of today’s cities
                is dependent on huge amounts of resources drawn
                through worldwide supply chains and over-extensive
                ecological areas. This situation creates a one-way
                flow of plant nutrients from distant ecosystems that
                are not then replenished at source. The impacts of
                greenhouse gas emissions and prevailing extractive
                practices lead to climate change and the progressive
                loss of soil productivity and biodiversity in the source
                ecosystems (see Figure 3).</p>
                <p>At the same time, urban sprawl leads to the progressive
                urbanisation of local landscapes. Unidirectional resource
                flows contribute to waste-related nutrient and chemical
                pollution of land and water systems peripheral to the
                settlement. River systems become depleted and polluted,
                contributing to distant dead zones in coastal seas around
                the world. Other long-distance impacts include the
                huge land take, such as in the Amazon region, for the</p>

                the world. Other long-distance impacts include the
                huge land take, such as in the Amazon region, for the production of soya beans used for feeding pigs in
                other global regions and in turn feeding humans in
                yet another place. The lack of cyclic systems then results
                in fertiliser run-off, and slurry and sewage pollution in
                rivers, causing excess nitrification.</p>
                <p>As just one of many, almost uniform, global examples,
                18th-century London was largely fed from its hinterland,
                but as it grew, it became ever-more dependent on remote
                sources of food and nutrients. A major downside of a
                world in which Petropolis has become dominant is
                that it is profoundly vulnerable to disruptions across a
                broad spectrum of supporting ecosystems, geopolitical
                regions and supply chains.</p>
                <div className="image figure2"></div>
                <p className="figureText">Figure 2. This diagram draws on the work of the 19th-century geographer Heinrich von Thünen. Agropolis is embedded
                in a horticultural and agricultural hinterland. Its existence depends on a continuous give-and-take: reaping an annual
                harvest for its inhabitants in exchange for returning human and animals waste back to the land. (© Herbert Girardet
                and Rick Lawrence)</p>
                <p>Ecopolis. This new urban paradigm has to be the model
                of the nature-compatible city of the future. It should not
                be regarded as a retrograde concept, but one of dynamic
                innovation and progress. Fossil-fuel dependence
                will give way to efficient use of renewable energy
                technologies. And, crucially, the urban system needs
                to be designed to be compatible with its supporting ecosystems, so as to develop a regenerative, circular
                metabolism (see Figure 4). This entails emulating the
                circularity of natural ecosystems, recycling waste
                resources from human consumption back into the
                environment where they are safely reintegrated and
                regenerated through natural processes. Among other
                measures, this entails applying the nutrients and carbon
                contained in human excrement and organic wastes to
                the farmland supplying food to cities. Recycled plastics
                from the urban waste stream would be used in road
                construction and other long-life infrastructure. The
                emphasis is on ceasing the linear ‘take, take, take’
                model of the modern economy and learning from
                nature about the necessity of cyclic systems for the
                achievement of sustainability.</p>
                <div className="image figure3"></div>
                <p className="figureText">Figure 3. The modern city, Petropolis, depends on massive daily inputs of non-renewable fossil fuels for all its
                internal functions as well as its external transport connections. Critically, food is often brought in from distant
                locations, causing cities to have vast global ecological footprints. This future of this kind of urbanisation looks highly
                problematic. (© Herbert Girardet and Rick Lawrence)</p>
                <h4>Toward Urban Self-Reliance</h4>
                <p>The essential paradigm shift towards an Ecopolis
                model is more profound than the biophilia approach,
                popularised by E.O. Wilson3
                and others, that reflects the
                innate human attraction to nature and natural processes
                built up through an evolutionary history of living in forested and agrarian settings. Rather, it suggests an
                ecophilia approach, which is broader based and takes into
                account the wider issue of the reliance of cities on distant
                ecosystems. Thus natural processes are embedded into
                the interactions between people and ecosystems, and
                are supported to create a regenerative urban agenda
                and economic model of progress.</p>
                <p>The entire metabolism of cities needs to be taken into
                account: biophysical, technical, industrial and even
                financial. There is a pressing need to think and develop
                urban systems on the basis of nature’s cyclic processes:
                the carbon, nutrient and water cycles. This applies to all
                areas of human activity, including the need to account
                for the wider geographical dependencies on water drawn
                from distant, upstream catchments, and the supply
                chains of food and other resources consumed by the
                urban metabolism. The Ecopolis concept can also form
                the basis for a new, resilient green urban economy,
                particularly for city regions currently caught in the
                downward spiral of depression and poverty as former
                industrial activities fall into decline.</p>
                <p>There is nothing regressive about this change in
                paradigm. The innovative and forward-looking cyclic
                city thinks in terms of innovation as a basis for greater
                security and greater liveability for its citizens. A novel
                green economy, championing all aspects of regenerative
                development, would offer livelihoods to large numbers
                of people. It would convert organic waste into productive
                compost and recycle industrial waste into material of
                value for long-term uses. It would switch to regionally
                autonomous renewable systems instead of relying on
                dwindling, expensive and polluting fossil fuels drawn
                from remote and often politically problematic regions.
                It may, for example, conceive of drawing on methane
                from sewage for power generation, as Bristol did with
                its innovative ‘poo buses’. The urban food system would
                become more localised and less reliant on high-energy
                inputs and international supply chains.</p>
                <p>Pertinent urban examples of such transformations include
                concrete measures already implemented in Adelaide,
                Australia, where measures towards mainstreaming water
                efficiency, circular waste management, reforestation and
                renewable energy have created a very substantial new
                green economy. This transition, aimed at South Australia
                becoming a sustainable region, was based on a 32-point
                plan that I put to the Australian government
                4
                and is
                discussed as a case study in the article ‘Cities with a
                plan’. Further global exemplars of urban evolutions
                are seen in the Welsh government’s Our Valleys, Our
                Future programme,

                stimulus policies for renewable energy, including under
                the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>

                of natural ecosystems, which would be embedded both in both ecological and economic practices of cities. (© Herbert

                <h4>Challenges and Solutions</h4>
                <p>Urban societies today tend to have a profound lack of
                understanding about the impacts of their demands and
                actions. For instance, there is little understanding about
                how clean water is available on tap, and wastewater is
                flushed away with no sense of connection with water
                catchments that are both sources and sinks. In business,
                too, fresh water supply and wastewater disposal are
                generally conceived as matters of commercial transaction
                with water service companies, with little understanding
                of them as natural resource dependencies.</p>
                <p>The same can generally be said of food chains and their
                associated waste streams, often procuring out-of-season
                or other cheaply produced crops together with their
                constituent nutrient, carbon and energy content through
                long international supply chains. Ironically, while global
                society heads towards peak phosphorus – global demand
                outstripping exploitable supplies – we also suffer a surfeit
                of nutrient pollution of fresh waters and in coastal dead
                zones as well as farming methods that drive loss of soil
                fertility and biodiversity. As one pertinent example: the
                nutrient content of soya beans grown on former forest
                soils in the Brazilian Amazon, and then procured on
                international markets, significantly contribute to pig
                manure pollution of the China’s Yangtze River, in turn
                contaminating the water supplies of those who consume
                these pork products.</p>
                <p>But there is now an increasing awareness of these
                matters from media reports. For instance, television
                documentaries highlighting the accumulation of
                single-use plastic items in the oceans, leading to the
                strangling of turtles and dolphins, triggered a strong
                emotional reaction in the general public, which helped to
                kick start some initial regulatory responses and business
                innovation. Reconnection of urban societies with their
                environmental dependencies and impacts is vital to
                stimulate proportionate responses.</p>
                <p>Creating regenerative cities is a pressing priority in the
                urban world we are building, which is synonymous
                with the Anthropocene era. Biological and technical
                regeneration must necessarily work hand in hand, and
                the metabolism of cities must both re-localise but also
                develop sustainable, cyclic relationships with the broader hinterlands upon which they ultimately depend for
                their sustenance.</p>
                <p>By and large, Ecopolis is still a vision in the making, but
                a necessary one, as human numbers and urbanisation
                continue to boom. We and our cities are, after all, living
                entities with metabolisms that are umbilically connected
                with this planet’s supportive ecosystems.</p>
