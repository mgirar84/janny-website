                    <p><h4>Adelaide's regenerative green economy</h4>
                    By the 1990s, Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia,
                    was facing a series of interconnected problems. As in
                    many European and US cities, the industries upon which
                    the city’s wealth had been founded were in decline,
                    causing unemployment and social tensions. And the
                    Murray–Darling River, draining around one-seventh of
                    the continent’s land mass and serving as South Australia’s
                    main source of water, was in serious decline in terms
                    both of water quantity and quality, due to multiple
                    demands from agriculture and urban consumption, as
                    well as the effects of a warming climate. This threatened
                    not merely the security of water supply, but also of food
                    and energy.

                <h4>Creating a new normal</h4>
                <p>Simply trying to rebuild the region’s old economy was
                manifestly not an option in the face of the sunsetting of
                former industries and increasingly grave natural-resource
                limitations. In 2003, the government of South Australia
                took the bold decision to initiate a thinkers-in-residence
                programme, inviting researchers from around the world
                to examine the situation and make proposals for change.
                I (Herbie Girardet) was the first thinker to be invited, and
                my task was to explore how South Australia’s economy
                could be put on a sustainable footing: how water, food
                and resource efficiency and renewable energy could
                become the basis of a new green economy.</p>
                <p>It quickly became apparent that the region was making
                very inefficient use of resources and that it was necessary
                to examine its ‘metabolism’. How could an inefficient,
                petrochemically dependent urban model, with its many
                associated vulnerabilities, be replaced? How could new
                opportunities be found for new smart technologies and
                greener jobs? The focus of the work was not just Adelaide
                itself, with a population of 1.2 million, but the whole of
                South Australia, with its 1.7 million people.</p>
                <p>The very special situation I found was that both the
                premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, and his entire
                cabinet and much of the civil service backed my work.
                In innumerable seminars over a 10-week period,
                people from all sectors of South Australia’s society
                came together to discuss future prospects. It was soon
                clear that no single institution alone could achieve the
                systemic transformation needed, extending as it did
                beyond the authority, remit and perspective of each
                sector. Academics, non-governmental organisations
                (NGOs), politicians, business leaders, trade unionists
                and civil servants all came together to create a
                coherent vision for change. It became possible to
                develop deep, new partnerships and share learning
                across all affected bodies.</p>
                <p>At the end of my stay, in May 2003, I submitted a
                32-point plan called Creating a Sustainable Adelaide. This
                was examined by a cabinet committee and eventually 
                approved in its entirety. It led to a multi-stakeholder
                implementation process to make substantial advances
                in building a substantial green economy for Adelaide
                and, indeed, for the whole of South Australia.1</p>
                <h4>Green outcomes achieved</h4>
                <p> Seventeen years from its inception, outcomes of
                the work span multiple dimensions. The region
                has achieved greatly enhanced water and energy
                renewability. Its electricity system now boasts 60
                per cent renewable supply from wind and solar,
                and the world’s largest battery has been installed to
                deal with supply fluctuations (see Figure 1). South
                Australia has become a living demonstration that
                novel energy systems can form the basis of urban
                regeneration in a post-industrial setting, displacing
                damaging fossil-fuel-based technologies while also
                regenerating local economies. Water-efficiency
                measures have also been implemented across the 
                region, with wastewater recovered from treatment
                plants used in park and farmland irrigation. Some
                3 million trees have been planted for soil erosion
                control and carbon sequestration. Key outcomes of
                the new policies implemented by the South Australia
                government are summarised below.</p>
                <div className="greyBackground">
                    <h4>Key outcomes in South Australia</h4>

                        <li>Reclaimed wastewater and urban compost used to cultivate that land;</li>
                        <li>Large-scale programmes to improve the energy performance of buildings across the region;</li>

                        <li>and Thousands of new green jobs.2</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>The prospect of creating a major new green jobs
                sector was one of the primary triggers that influenced change by the government. Policy stimuli towards
                the development of an increasingly cyclical urban
                economy have proven to be a profitable enabler of
                progress towards sustainability. Regulation, markets,
                technological innovation, targeted impartial advice
                and other measures have all achieved demonstrable
                progress. In all this, government agencies have
                played key roles in establishing frameworks for
                cross-sectoral collaboration to achieve clearly framed,
                desirable outcomes.</p>
                <p>Adelaide has also become an exemplar of what can
                be done to reconnect a city to its hinterland. Stimuli
                towards large-scale urban fringe agriculture and
                viticulture are also an integral part of the local scene.
                Progress made in Adelaide, and South Australia as
                a whole, demonstrates the powers of a collaborative
                approach extending beyond the authority, remit and
                perspective of any single societal sector.</p>
                <p>South Australia now sets a global standard for
                the rebuilding of post-industrial city-regions and
                economies, based on the cyclical and efficient use of
                waste, water, food and energy, and the development of
                novel technologies. Cumulatively, these demonstrate
                the benefits of a more sustainable, or indeed
                regenerative, greener economy. Adelaide stands as the
                tangible and successful basis for transferrable lessons
                for the future development of other city-regions across
                the world.</p>
