                <h3>Urban Transitions</h3>
                <p>This interview was conducted by Prof. Marilyne Andersen, MIT, 
                    at the Urban Transitions Global Summit in
                    Shanghai on 10. July 2018</p>

                        <h4>What’s your position on sustainability?</h4>
                        <p>“Sustain” is a very passive term. We live on a profoundly damaged planet. Sustaining it in this depleted
                        condition is no longer good enough. The relationship between the way we live in our human settlements and
                        the world beyond must become much more pro-active.</p>
                        <p>“Sustainable” is also a term that is both corrupted and grossly overused. There are many other terms that can
                        be used to define the way we should manage our cities – such as liveable, resilient, smart, intelligent and
                        responsible, for instance. I prefer to use the term “regenerative”. Regenerative cities are environmentally-
                        enhancing, restorative urban systems that maintain a responsible relationship with the natural resources on
                        which they depend. They are not only energy-efficient and low carbon, but also designed to have positive
                        impacts on their local and regional ecosystems.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>What are the major challenges when it comes to achieving a regenerative built environment?</h4>
                <p>Cities tend to have an egocentric tendency, thinking that they can declare independence from nature, which
                is a rather catastrophic way of thinking. Cities are, in fact, dependent systems, relying upon ecosystem
                services somewhere out there. It’s not good enough to simply look at a city in terms of its morphology as
                planners tend to do; we need to take a closer look at the linkages - pipes and cables connecting the city to the
                wider hinterland, the power stations, and food and water sources.</p>
                <p>The 19 th century German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen 1 showed that in the absence of major road,
                canal or river transport systems, cities had to ensure steady food and timber supplies from close by. They had
                to give back in order to survive. There had to be a give and take between human settlements and their
                hinterlands. I refer to this traditional type of human settlement, as “Agropolis”</p>
                <p>We don’t live in the Agropolis anymore; we live in “Petropolis” the city powered by fossil fuels from global
                sources. It all started with the Industrial Revolution. Today, with access to resources across the planet - at least
                in the global North - we take but don’t give back very much. That is one of the most critical issues in an
                urbanizing world. We need to understand that we must look beyond physical structures towards processes
                found in natural ecosystems and replace our current, inefficient linear system of resource extraction and waste
                disposal with a resource-efficient circular urban metabolism.</p>
                <p>A massive daily injection of stored sunlight, in the form of coal, oil and gas, is the primary condition for
                making contemporary urban systems possible. This is the key issue we now have to deal with. Of course,
                individual consumers cannot be expected to spearhead modern, eco-friendly, responsible lifestyles. In order to
                spark the significant changes that are needed in the energy and resource performance of our cities, we need
                national policies that go beyond existing perspectives.</p>
                <p>New technical options do exist and must be driven by policy, particularly when it comes to wind and solar
                power and energy storage. Yet, even with rapidly implementing ever cheaper novel energy technologies
                that are now becoming available, we still won’t be able to lower atmospheric carbon concentrations. We can only do that by finding various ways to sequester carbon, preferably by natural means like reforestation
                and carbon storage in soils. Yet, at the same time, forests in many places are on fire, or dying due to climate
                stress and disease-related issues. This is a very worrying development.</p>
                <p>The challenge we now face is that of turning our cities into ecologically and economically-restorative
                systems. In my view we need to move into a new kind of city, which I call “Ecopolis”. There are many
                existing cities around the world that could be made to run on efficient, renewable energy systems and to
                actively reconnect them to their local hinterland. Some cities have already moved strongly in this direction.
                In this context, energy democracy is an interesting issue to discuss: no longer relying on mega power station
                monopolies but implementing a much more democratic “prosumer” approach wherein consumers can also
                become energy producers.</p>
                <h4>How do you envision the role of buildings between now and 2050?</h4>
                <p>From World War II onwards, fossil fuel energy was so freely available that people didn’t worry much
                about building design and its relationship to energy and the larger environment. That has obviously become
                a major challenge, mainly due to concerns about climate change.</p>
                <p>Optimizing the energy performances of buildings is becoming a critical issue. Passive and solar design are
                now becoming mainstream, and technology has improved a great deal, with tremendous innovation in
                insulation materials and solar technology. Thus, a great many new options have suddenly become available
                and are directly relevant to the future of not only individual building construction, but the design of entire
                cities.</p>
                <p>Energy self-sufficient buildings or energy+ buildings are no longer just a theory; they’re a reality. However,
                we mustn’t limit ourselves to buildings’ energy performances alone. First and foremost, buildings are places
                where people want to enjoy life. So how architecture responds to that is another big issue.</p>
                <p>I think there is also renewed interest in community gardens, which were both popular and a necessity in the
                19 th century in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries. Back then, people - who often had
                migrated from villages to urban areas - wanted to keep growing some of their own food for their families. I
                believe intra- and peri-urban farming and gardening is essential for the future of urban food supplies.
                Emerging technology-driven options also undoubtedly provide relevant tools, like vertical farming which can
                be done in old factory buildings and does not necessarily require purpose-built greenhouses.</p>
                <h4>What are the major obstacles to achieving energy-efficient or active buildings?</h4>
                <p>Taking the example of the BedZED 2 project, the first of its kind in Britain, cost overruns were a significant
                issue, partly because it introduced new features that had to be specially designed for the project. Generally
                speaking, initial investments for high-performance projects pose problems, even if operating costs are lower
                and the project will be cost-effective in the long run. However, Passivhaus design is quickly becoming cost-
                competitive with conventional design. Still, we need more policies and incentives. The market alone cannot
                solve the problem.</p>
                <h4>Can you give us some examples of your own work that has contributed to the field?</h4>
                <p>In 2003, I was invited to be a ‘Thinker in Residence’ in Adelaide, Australia. The goal was to come up with
                proposals for improving the efficiency of an energy/resource-intensive city region of some 1.3 million people,
                and, crucially, to help create a substantial new green economy. In a very intense 10-week period I held daily
                seminars and lectures with people from all sectors of society. I came up with a 32-point plan, 31 of which 
                were implemented within a few months 3 . These included measures for energy-efficient retrofitting of
                buildings, large-scale tree planting, water security measures, sustainable transport policies, 100% organic
                waste recycling and support for peri-urban agriculture. Subsequently, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy
                were added and Adelaide now has over 50% electricity supplies from wind and solar technology.
                Ultimately, we were able to achieve a remarkable, regenerative urban transformation, moving actively
                towards creating a circular metabolism whilst creating thousands of new green jobs.</p>
                <p>More recently, I was also involved in a project called Dongtan Eco-City on Chongming Island, in the
                Yangtze delta. The Shanghai city government wanted to build a city that would not pollute the island,
                which is largely farmland and home to a bird sanctuary. The plan was to build an eco-city for half a million
                people by 2030. I was working as a consultant for Arup 4 , the multinational engineering firm. The idea was
                to design an Ecopolis that would be largely powered by renewable energy, would be car-free, where waste
                water would be recycled and reused for irrigation, and that would have a circular metabolism. The Ecopolis
                was to be built on farmland, yet without reducing the total amount of produce grown on that land.
                Unfortunately, the project did not come to fruition for political reasons.</p>
                <h4>Who are the key initiators of change? Are new professions to emerge or roles to evolve?</h4>
                <p>Back in the United Kingdom I was involved in introducing feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy. That had a
                dramatic effect on the uptake of renewable energy – especially solar – at the local level. This experience
                highlights the importance of appropriate national policies, which I believe are key to creating a world of
                regenerative cities. The market itself is lazy! It doesn’t want to innovate unless it’s for profit and, by itself, is
                not fit to create truly liveable and environmentally compatible cities.</p>

                not fit to create truly liveable and environmentally compatible cities.</p>
                <p>At the other end of the scale are citizens. Environmentally-conscious behavior patterns are still difficult to
                instil in people, but we’re slowly getting there. We are now ‘amplified’ by technology – I use the term
                ‘amplified man’ – with our reliance on ever technologies and gadgets. Although many devices have become
                ever smaller and more energy-efficient, we use more of them than ever before – cars, washing machines, cell
                phones, industrial robots, etc. Greater awareness of our impacts is badly needed. Informing users of the full
                impacts of our lifestyles is a key driver of change.</p>
                <p>In terms of professions, I believe the role of engineers is becoming more important. Civil engineering is
                evolving and taking a growing interest in ecology and the metabolism of cities. All major engineering firms
                like ARUP, for instance, now have ecology departments. The latter are still smaller than other departments,
                like structural engineering, but they’re growing rapidly.</p>
                <p>The whole environmental consultancy field has grown a great deal in recent years. When I first started in
                this, it was hard to make a living. Nowadays, you see ads for ecological and environmental engineering
                positions everywhere. These are encouraging signs. Still, change can be further speeded up by appropriate
                policies.</p>
                <p>A crucial driver for making an energy and regenerative development turnaround happen is to realize that
                there is huge economic potential in these sectors. This became very evident in my work in Adelaide. A lot of
                cities have suffered from job losses due to automation, industrial relocation, etc. But energy can be supplied
                more locally and recycling can become an integral part of the functioning of urban systems, and this means
                that jobs can come back to the urban arena. But, again, that is something that won’t happen automatically -
                it has to be driven by both national- and community-level enabling policies.</p>
