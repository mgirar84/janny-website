                    <p> It has become apparent that in a human context ecology is rather an elusive creature which has
                        a habit of playing hide and seek with those who try to pin it down. Unlike with plants and
                        animals, our impacts on the global environment transcend the purely biological context,
                        depending on who we have become regarding our technological and cultural development. In
                        ecological terms, a hunter-gatherer or a peasant farmer is not the same creature as a member
                        of an urban-industrial society. And we seem to find it hard to make up our minds whether we
                        regard ourselves as part of nature or as supra-natural beings, not really knowing where nature
                        ends and where culture starts.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        This situation is vividly illustrated when we look at the statistics of our energy consumption: It is
                        reckoned that by the 1960s every European used at least 80 ‘energy slaves’, the energy
                        equivalent to the muscle power of 80 strong men using hand tools. Of course, this energy is
                        mostly supplied by fossil fuels. The rest of the world is aspiring to similar levels of per capita
                        energy consumption. In developing countries, fossil fuels use is invariably increasing as part of
                        economic and urban growth. The decolonialisation of Third World countries is speeding up
                        industrialisation in the quest for greater affluence, and demands redistribution of the world's
                        resources of which we consume such an unequal share.

                </div>
                <p>
                But what about our environmental impacts? If we consume 80 times as much energy as our
                ‘natural' ancestors, each of us has as much environmental impact in one year as they had in 80
                years. We’d better think carefully about our actions, particularly those that affect the
                environment in irreversible ways. Surely this is a persuasive argument for keeping built-in on
                obsolescence out of our buildings and our settlements.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Our current lifestyles are possible only by us grabbing deeply into the pockets of other nations
                and of future generations. The latter can't fight back, but the former – as liberation wars and raw
                material cartels have shown – will now want to supply raw materials to us on their terms,
                potentially with considerable consequences for Western levels of production and consumption.
                After the oil crisis of 1973, the precarious state of Western economies is witness to the changing
                balance of world economic power. In the USA, President Carter's energy-saving program, and
                the demand by Third World nations for a new world economic order, are two sides of the same
                coin. It could significantly reduce inequality between nations, with the potential for substantial
                impacts on global economic development patterns.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Cultures that consume 80 times the energy available to them from sustainable natural sources
                must surely be living on borrowed time. We mut should revise the ingrained concept of
                seemingly inevitable economic growth, and take the idea of creating steady-state economies
                seriously. This certainly has major implications for employment and production patterns.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The sustainability of our lifestyles and of our settlements must surely be high on the list of our
                priorities. It seems to me that it is high time to shed our short-term priorities for long-term,
                ecologically defined perspectives. The only way we can do justice to future generations is to
                define ways of using resources in ways that will be of long-lasting benefit. This means building
                settlement structures which future generations will be glad to inhabit and to inherit from us.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In which way, then, should ecological considerations influence settlement planning? First of all,
                this means no longer being subservient to short-term profit and loss accounting criteria, ignoring
                the wasteful use of non-renewable resources. And it also means assuring a 'closer fit’ between
                a given culture and its geographical and climatic setting, prioritising the use of local ‘income
                energy’ sources over reliance on precarious, long-distance energy supplies.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The ecological impact of a given culture is above all else determined by its 'metabolism', its
                throughput of resources, and therefore resource productivity is a crucial factor. But productivity
                planning is not ‘neutral’: ecological impacts are strongly influenced by the underlying ideology of
                production, i.e., production for quick profit versus production for long-term use value. The latter
                must surely gain in strategic importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ecological development planning cannot flourish in a vacuum. It must take the status quo as a
                starting point, including prevailing employment patterns, production levels and settlement
                structures. Even if we bring about a rapid reduction of our level of energy consumption and
                productivity, our impacts on the global environment and future generations will continue to be
                massive. We must therefore urgently focus our attention above all else on planning and
                investment decisions that are likely to have long-lasting ecological and social benefits. We must
                develop and propose plausible alternatives, and then appeal to the public for support.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                To some extent the Town and Country Planning Association is already doing this. It has put
                innovative concepts for settlement planning firmly on the public policy agenda. As people
                demand more sustainable homes and more space to exist on, it should make sure that
                ecological concepts are seen as a non-negotiable frame of reference. In this context the Garden
                City guidelines proposed by Ebenezer Howard and championed by the TCPA are still highly
                relevant. His ideas on the more even distribution of the population on a given land surface are
                implicitly ecological, and are relevant today as much as they were 70 years ago.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The question who we humans are in ecological terms is closely linked to the places where we
                live and, and how we live in them. The need for our settlements to be sustainable as regards
                our use of energy and raw materials should be regarded as non-negotiable, embedding
                development and settlement planning in the context of global ecological and economic
                relationships. There are surely limits to our use of resources, and particularly energy resources.
                In particular: can urban planners look to the prudent use of income energies (sun, wind, hydro,
                geo-thermal, biofuels) as the predominant energy supply for our settlements?
