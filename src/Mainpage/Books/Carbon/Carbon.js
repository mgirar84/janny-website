                <h3>Carbon and the biosphere</h3>
                <p className="chapterDescription">This is a slightly abridged version of the second chapter of Herbert Girardet &
                Miguel Mendonca, ‘A Renewable World’, Green Books, Dartington, 2009, a report
                to the World Future Council</p>
                <p>There is growing scientific evidence that to avoid a climate catastrophe in the coming
                decades we need not just to reduce carbon emissions, but, beyond that, to reduce actual
                concentrations of CO2 already present in the earth’s atmosphere. This is an agenda that
                goes significantly beyond the targets currently being pursued by the world’s ‘climate
                guardians’ such the IPCC.</p>
                <p>Jim Hansen, the eminent climate researcher and director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for
                Space Studies, has indicated that the IPCC has been much too cautious in its assessments
                and that we are rapidly reaching crucial tipping points which compel us to act very rapidly
                indeed to prevent run-away climate change. In an interview published in 2008 he said this:</p>
                <p>“Recent greenhouse gas emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate
                change ... There is already enough carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere for massive ice sheets
                such as West Antarctica to eventually melt away, and ensure that sea levels will rise metres
                in coming decades. Climate zones such as the tropics and temperate regions will continue to
                shift, and the oceans will become more acidic, endangering much marine life. We must begin
                to move rapidly to the post-fossil fuel clean energy system. Moreover, we must remove some
                carbon that has collected in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.” 1</p>
                <p>Hansen’s views have been reinforced by alarming news about melting mountain glaciers and
                by the unprecedented thinning of polar ice, with the prospect that summer ice in the Arctic
                may largely disappear in a matter of years. Far more solar energy will be absorbed into the
                arctic oceans as their colour turns dark as ice dissolves during the summer months. This and
                other positive feedbacks are the alarm signals of an unprecedented crisis that have led the
                Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon to refer to a global climate emergency.</p>
                <p>So, where do we go from here? By 2009 global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have
                already reached 387 parts per million (ppm), up by 40 per cent from 275 ppm in 1900. Until
                recently a doubling to 550 ppm was widely regarded as acceptable, but this was revised
                downwards to some 450 ppm as new scientific evidence about a warming planet emerged.
                Now most climatologists are profoundly concerned about even this seemingly small increase,
                and argue for an actual reduction of CO2 concentrations to 350 ppm or below. This goes way
                beyond scenarios currently being proposed by governments in developed countries.</p>
                <p>The problem is that every year we are now discharging nearly 10 billion tonnes of carbon into
                the atmosphere. Of this, four to five billion tonnes are not being reabsorbed into the world’s
                ecosystems, but are accumulating in the atmosphere. Are there possibilities to absorb
                surplus greenhouse gas emissions, and, beyond that, to find ways to actually reduce existing
                GHG concentrations?</p>
                <p>There has been much talk about the potential of removing carbon by technical means
                through carbon capture and storage, or geo-sequestration. Yet even if CCS were to succeed
                on a substantial scale, it will not deal with carbon already present in the atmosphere. We
                need alternative approaches, and particularly bio-sequestration, which can deal with new
                emissions as well as existing CO2 concentrations – if done on a large enough scale.</p>
                <p>For global temperatures to stabilise, carbon emissions must ultimately not exceed what can
                be absorbed by the biosphere, the Earth's vegetation, soils and oceans. So, can we find
                ways to enhance the capacity of the biosphere to absorb CO2?</p>
                <p>There is no question that this is a controversial issue, particularly regarding the idea of using
                reforestation for carbon sequestration purposes. For instance, in a joint statement in 2006
                Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and WWF-UK strongly argued against ‘reforestation sink
                projects’, mainly because “large-scale monoculture tree plantations often have negative
                impacts on the environment and forest communities”. 2</p>
                <p>A number of other publications detail the perceived fallacy of carbon offsets. A report called
                ‘The Carbon Neutral Myth – Offset Indulgences for your Climate Sins,’ rails against the idea
                of people in the rich countries obtaining ‘permission’ to burn oil, gas and coal by paying for
                carbon offsets – more often than not by tree planting projects somewhere in the Global South
                where “projects are being imposed on communities with little consultation.” 3</p>
                <p>These objections certainly must be taken seriously. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the need
                to find ways of enhancing the capacity of the earth’s living environment to absorb carbon. Not
                only can this help to reduce atmospheric carbon concentrations but, if done right, it can also
                increase the options for sustainable food and timber production for a growing global
                population. In a world challenged by climate change and biodiversity loss as well as hunger,
                it is critically important to undertake new initiatives which can have such multiple benefits.</p>
                <p>A key point to be considered is that whilst fossil fuel burning has massively increased in the
                last 300 years, the capacity of the biosphere to absorb it has been significantly reduced at
                the same time: A frequently quoted figure is that 200 to 250 billions tons of carbon have been
                lost from the biosphere in the last 300 years. This resulted from -</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>deforestation</li>
                    <li>biodiversity loss</li>
                    <li>accelerated soil erosion</li>

                    <li>costal water pollution and</li>
                    <li>acidification of the oceans</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A key argument we need to use is that carbon dioxide should be regarded not simply as a
                bad that has to be stored in underground caverns out of harm’s way, but that it can be turned
                into a good that can be used to enhance the wellbeing of the biosphere and humanity. All
                living beings are primarily made of carbon. Can the disruptive human impact on nature’s
                carbon cycle, which is causing ever worsening instabilities, be brought back into balance by
                deliberate action?</p>
                <h4>A matter of balance</h4>
                <p>A healthy balance sheet matches income and outgoings – in fact, on the balance sheet of a
                thriving company or household, income exceeds outgoings. But not so in the world’s global
                carbon balance sheet: year after year we have been running up ever greater deficits. For
                instance, WWF’s annual Living Planet Reports indicate clearly that in our dealings with
                nature we have been creating ever greater imbalances. The annual WWF Living Planet
                Reports tell us that we are consuming the resources that underpin the world’s ecosystems
                services much faster than they are being replenished. Humanity’s global ecological footprint
                now exceeds the world’s capacity to regenerate by about 30 percent. 4 Indisputably, this
                state of affairs cannot continue.</p>
                <p>The main constituent of life on earth is carbon, drawn from carbon dioxide in the earth’s
                atmosphere. It is the chemical basis of all known life, and forms more compounds than any
                other element, with some ten million so far identified by science. Variations in carbon dioxide
                levels in the atmosphere have been known for some time to influence the impact of solar
                radiation on the earth, and with that, the earth’s climate. Around 2,000 gigatonnes of carbon
                are present in the world’s soils and vegetation and have been fairly constant over the last few
                million years. The earth’s remaining fossil fuel reserves amount to approximately 1,200
                gigatonnes, or 1.2 trillion tonnes. Around 900 gigatonnes of these are coal, and the
                remaining oil and gas reserves each amount to around 150 gigatonnes. 5</p>
                <p>Over the course of some 300 million years, carbon was drawn down by living organisms from
                the atmosphere and ‘relocated’ in the earth’s crust, ultimately becoming fossil fuels. These
                were formed out of biomass that was deposited on the ocean floor by sea organisms, by
                organic particles that were washed into the sea, and out of plant and animal matter on land
                which was then covered over by sediments and more decaying organic matter.</p>
                <p>In the last 300 years we have reversed this process of biological carbon sequestration, and
                have transferred hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon back into the atmosphere, with
                increasingly dire consequences. How can we balance the books? How can humanity re-
                establish a carbon cycle where income and outgoings are matched?</p>
                <p>This matter is addressed in some detail by the IPCC reports published in recent years, and
                some mitigation measures have been agreed by the international community. However, new
                thinking about how large amounts of carbon already present in the atmosphere can be
                sequestered is now urgently needed.</p>
                <p>According to the Global Carbon Project, the land and ocean carbon sinks – such as forests
                and plankton in the ocean – removed about 54 percent, or 4.8 billion tonnes a year of the
                carbon that humans discharged into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2007. That leaves a
                carbon surplus of about 4 billion tonnes or so per year, which we need to find ways to reduce
                or absorb. 6</p>
                <p>We must take a new look at how better land-use and forest management can further
                enhance biological carbon sequestration. There has been much discussion about the
                feasibility of geo-sequestration of CO2 from power stations, refineries, etc. However, there is
                little doubt now we should prioritise biological carbon capture and storage (BCCS), or bio-
                sequestration, through deliberate measures of forest protection, reforestation and the
                improvement of soil by incorporation of compost and ‘biochar’.</p>
                <p>In this context it is important to realise that well thought out bio-sequestration has multiple
                benefits to nature and human society: in addition to absorbing surplus carbon, it also offers
                significant opportunities for biodiversity protection, soil erosion prevention and, potentially,
                enhanced food production and poverty reduction in rural areas. This could even help to
                enhance the economic viability of rural communities in an age in which billions of people
                have been forced to move to cities for a better life/ to earn a better living.</p>
                <h4>Forests for life</h4>
                <p>Global forest cover extends to nearly 4 billion hectares, or 30 percent of the world’s land
                surface. 7 The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recently done a Forest
                Resources Assessment which states that the world’s forests contain 638 gigatonnes of
                carbon – which is more than the total carbon contained in the atmosphere. 8</p>
                <p>Forest ecosystems are crucially important components of the global carbon cycle in several
                ways. They remove some 3 billion tonnes of carbon every year through net growth,
                absorbing nearly 30 percent of all C02 emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation. 9</p>
                <p>Healthy forests also play a crucial role as global ecological life-support systems. Reports
                such as UNEP’s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment make it clear that the goods and
                services provided by forests are worth trillions of dollars to the global economy. In addition to
                carbon sequestration, they provide a wide range of ‘ecosystem services’ of benefit to all life:
                they are wildlife habitats, biodiversity centres, climate regulators and watershed protectors –
                not to mention medicine cabinets and cosmetics counters. These services are effectively of
                no cost to human society, and they are absent from humanity’s balance sheet and their
                critical contributions to the viability of life on earth are largely overlooked in decision-making.
                This problem needs to be urgently addressed: we need to recognise forests as important
                natural assets with economic and social value and do what is necessary to promote their
                protection and regeneration. 10</p>
                <p>As human populations and their economies grow, so do the resource demands imposed on
                ecosystems and the impacts of our collective, global ecological footprint. But society is
                coming to realise that as ecosystem services are threatened across the world, there is an
                urgent need to evaluate both their immediate and their long-term benefits to humanity.
                Increasingly, researchers have been able to quantify the economic value associated with
                ecosystem services based on assessing the cost of replacing these with ‘man-made’
                alternatives. 11</p>

                <h4>Source: UN (FAO) State of the World’s Forests 2001</h4>
                <h4>Deforestation, a global problem</h4>
                <p>Deforestation, particularly in the tropics, has long been regarded as a major environmental
                problem. It is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions and one of the
                primary contributors to climate change. The IPCC estimates that is responsible for 18 to 20
                percent of global carbon emissions. Deforestation today is concentrated in a few developing
                countries, primarily in the tropics, but countries all over the world will ultimately benefit from
                forest protection. So, new international forest conservation efforts are urgently needed.</p>
                <p>According to the FAO, between 2000 and 2005, the global annual net loss of forest area was
                7.3 million hectares per year, mainly in the tropics. 12 Given that tropical forests absorb about
                500 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, this represents a loss of CO2 sequestration capacity of 3.65
                billion tonnes. 13 As well as being a major threat to the climate, deforestation also affects 1.6
                billion of the world’s poorest people who directly depend on forests for their survival. 14
                Processes of deforestation vary from continent to continent. In South America it is driven
                primarily by logging and the expansion of large-scale farming, primarily to produce beef and
                Soybeans; in South East Asia forests are being cleared primarily for timber production and
                for the expansion of oil palm and coffee for global markets.</p>
                <p>The economic impacts of deforestation are immense. A 2008 study headed by Deutsche
                Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev, entitled The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity
                (TEEB), estimates that destruction of forests internationally is causing economic damage to
                the tune of $2 to $5 trillion, or up to seven percent of the global economy, annually. This
                calculation was done by placing value on the various services that healthy forests provide for
                free, such as carbon sequestration, food supply and water storage. Sukhdev emphasises
                that the cost of this decline dwarfs the recent losses on the financial markets. "It's not only
                greater but it's also continuous, it's been happening every year, year after year.” 15</p>
                <p>The Global Canopy Programme (GCP) – an alliance of 37 scientific institutions in 19
                countries – is a world leader in forest canopy research, education and conservation. The
                programme proposes realistic new ways of compensating countries and companies for
                protecting their forests, in their own interest as well as the interest of the world community.</p>
                <p>Andrew Mitchell, director of GCP, says that tropical rainforests are the ‘elephant in the living
                room of climate change’. 16 In other words, their presence may be overwhelmingly obvious,
                but few people know how to deal with it. His perspective is supported by the 2006 Stern
                Review which states that deforestation from 2008-2012 will be responsible for more
                greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than aviation since the invention of the aeroplane until at
                least 2025. It says that curbing deforestation should be regarded as a highly cost-effective
                way of reducing GHG emissions. 17</p>
                <h4>A view from the Amazon</h4>
                <p>In its entirety the Amazon Basin covers some 7 million square kilometres. The lion’s share,
                some 5 million square kilometres, is in Brazil, and the remainder stretches across eight other
                countries. At least 60 percent of the world’s remaining tropical rainforests, with their
                unsurpassed biodiversity - including some 55,000 different plant species - are to be found in
                the Amazon. Moreover, the forests in the Amazon Basin contain at least one-fifth the
                equivalent of all the carbon currently in the atmosphere, and recent studies show that intact
                Amazonian forests are also functioning as a globally significant carbon sink, even absorbing
                some of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from industrial emissions. 18</p>
                <p>Deforestation for logging, cattle ranching, Soybean production, mining and smallholder
                farming has so far affected about 20 percent of the Amazon forest, with the greatest impacts
                in the eastern and southern Amazon. Major concerns are not only carbon loss as a result of
                deforestation, but also changes in the moisture transfer across vast areas.</p>
                <p>The Amazon basin is an enormous heat engine, taking heat from the sun, turning it into
                water vapour and powering tropical air circulation. It has been shown through modelling by
                two Russian climate scientists that the multi-layered canopy of rainforests is ideal for the
                transfer of water through cloud formation over long distances – the so-called ‘River in the
                Sky. For instance, the only way water will transfer from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes is
                through the canopy of the Amazon rainforest. 19</p>
                <p>A report “Drought Sensitivity of the Amazon Rainforest” published by Science Magazine in
                March 2009, presents evidence that the Amazon rainforest is very sensitive to drought –
                which is likely to intensify under global warming. The 25 year study, which involved some 68
                scientists, has used the severe drought that struck the Amazon in September 2005 as a
                ”unique opportunity to directly evaluate the large-scale sensitivity of tropical forest to water
                deficits”. The study concluded that drought causes massive carbon loss in the forest - mainly
                through killing trees that were not able to tolerate the drier soil conditions. 20</p>
                <p>The researchers found that the Amazon forest normally absorbs nearly 2 billion tonnes of
                carbon dioxide each year, but in 2005 the dry conditions caused it to lose more than 3 billion
                tonnes of living biomass. “The total impact of the drought - 5 billion extra tonnes of carbon
                dioxide in the atmosphere - exceeds the annual emissions of Europe and Japan combined”,
                stated the press release from Leeds University, which led the research.</p>
                <p>Covering the research in The Independent newspaper, Steve Connor wrote: “The Amazon
                has long been the lungs of the world. But now comes dramatic evidence that we cannot rely
                on it in the fight against climate change”. 21</p>
                <p>Since the 2005 drought, the Brazilian government had some success in lowering the rate of
                deforestation. In 2006 deforestation was reduced by some 30 percent and all seemed to be
                going well. However in 2007, with the growing interest in biofuels and rising food prices
                (which was also partly because of biofuels) deforestation rates shot up again and it was clear
                that the government did not have deforestation under control. It remains to be seen whether
                the current world recession has reduced deforestation rates once again.</p>
                <p>While scientists and climatologists are hesitant about making predictions too far into the
                future, many believe that the forest system, particularly in the Eastern Amazon, is
                dangerously close to collapse and that drought could occur regularly in the coming years,
                with dire consequences for the area beyond, which depends on the Amazon for its rainfall.
                Brazilian hydrologists have shown that the Amazon basin evaporates some 20 billion tonnes
                of water daily and that the standing forest helps to lower surface air temperatures through
                evaporation. This evaporative cooling and the resulting recycling of water is crucial for all the
                other services provided by the forests, including carbon storage.</p>
                <p>Many scientists now think that we are approaching a critical point, certainly in the East
                Amazon. If the forest system were to collapse, this would disrupt huge energy and moisture
                flows which would have a ‘shockwave’ effect across the world’s climate systems. 22</p>
                <h4>New demands for forest products</h4>
                <p>Africa’s Congo Basin Forest, the largest expanse of tropical forest outside the Amazon, is
                coming under huge pressure from international timber markets. This is epitomised by a story
                from the environment editor of the Guardian newspaper John Vidal, who visited the region in
                2007 to write about the logging operations there. In a saw mill he saw several huge trees
                being cut up and when he asked where the timber was going to end up, the answer was: at
                the cycle track being built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>
                <p>Rapidly growing economies such as China are scouring the world for timber and other forest
                products. China now buys 55 percent of the Republic of Congo’s timber exports which come
                almost entirely from virgin forests. 23 Increasingly, not only timber but also palm oil and
                soybeans are being imported from ecologically vulnerable rainforest regions. Malaysia is
                supplying ever-growing amounts of palm oil from converted rainforests. In 2006 it exported
                some 14.4 million tonnes of palm oil and of this China imported nearly 3.6 million tonnes. 24
                In the last 20 years China has become the world's largest importer of whole Soybeans as
                well as oil and meal by-products. 25 Brazilian Soy exports to China, mainly from the Amazon
                and former savannah regions in Mato Grosso, increased from one million tons to four million
                tons between 1999 and 2003. 26</p>
                <p>“What if China reaches the U.S. consumption level per person?” asks Lester Brown, CEO of
                the Earth Policy Institute. “If China’s economy continues to expand at eight percent a year, its
                income per person will reach the current U.S. level in 2031. If at that point China’s per capita
                resource consumption were the same as in the United States today, then its projected 1.45
                billion people would consume the equivalent of two thirds of the current world grain harvest.
                China’s paper consumption would be double the world’s current production. There go the
                world’s forests.” 27</p>
                <p>It is, however, important to point out that China is only following in the footsteps of Europe,
                the US and Japan whose demands have been the primary contributor to deforestation in the
                tropics until recently, and this continues today despite substantial efforts by environmental
                lobbies such as the FSC to certify timber and other tropical forests products. We certainly
                need some new strategies to protect and renew forests around the world.</p>
                <h4>Ecosystem services and avoided deforestation</h4>
                <p>The fact the 1997 Kyoto agreement did not address the need to reduce emissions from
                deforestation is a major problem. This was partly due to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the
                emissions involved. The negotiators initially had difficulties with the measuring of emissions
                and setting suitable baselines, but this has since been rectified. In 1997 there was also a
                major concern that the sheer scale of carbon credits produced from ‘avoided deforestation’
                would tend to undermine incentives to reduce emissions by other sectors. As a result of
                these factors, reforestation projects were included in the agreement, but ‘avoided
                deforestation’ was left out.</p>
                <p>Today, technological advances such as satellite monitoring technology, have given us
                accurate measures of both annual forest losses and carbon emissions from deforestation.
                The notion that avoided deforestation should be included within international carbon markets
                is now being hotly debated. Many experts feel that without schemes for compensating
                developing countries for avoided deforestation, any post-Kyoto climate deal will not be able
                to achieve the global emissions reductions necessary to combat climate change.</p>
                <p>The Global Canopy Programme says that it is crucial to acknowledge that living forests
                provide valuable climatic services that deforested areas cannot provide, and the overall
                economic value we place on forests needs to reflect this. Thus the only way to curb further
                deforestation is to put a price on carbon contained in forests and so provide an incentive for
                developing countries to protect them.</p>
                <p>New financial incentives are important because the efforts of NGOs to reduce deforestation
                by appealing to the environmental and social responsibility of producers and consumers
                have so far had only limited success. Philanthropy has also been on an inadequate scale to
                deal with such a huge task. The urgency of the climate challenge means we must develop
                more effective and innovative methods of international cooperation to curb deforestation.</p>
                <p>There is a complex set of factors behind deforestation and they have to be well understood
                for any policy framework to be successful. The primary reason is that presently the
                conversion of forest to other land uses such as farming, plantations and mining is usually
                more profitable, particularly if it is supported by government policies, subsidies and
                international trade. Poorly defined property rights, non-transparency, financial gain by elites
                and weak law enforcement are other causes of deforestation. Any alternative policies
                intended to counter deforestation must deal with this complex set of issues.</p>
                <p>Experts agree that ecosystems - and especially tropical rainforests - must be a central part of
                any post-Kyoto agreement - because it is the most immediate and cost effective way to
                achieve real and significant reductions in GHG emissions. There is now growing consensus
                that financial compensation for avoided deforestation is the best way to reduce loss of
                forests, particularly in the tropics.</p>
                <h4>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)</h4>
                <p>Since 2005 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has
                been trying to create a new international policy framework to counter deforestation. REDD
                has been developed largely as a result of initiatives by developing countries, led by Costa
                Rica and Papua New Guinea. It is intended to enable these countries to earn credits for
                ‘avoided deforestation’. The idea is that developing countries which protect their forests,
                which can therefore continue to provide essential ecosystem services for the world, should
                be compensated for doing so. If REDD is to be part of a post-2012 climate deal, agreement
                must be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
                <p>If REDD is to work effectively it needs to address carbon emissions, biodiversity, ecosystem
                services and rural poverty alleviation all at the same time. Above all else, it must help assure
                sustainable livelihoods of forest-dependent communities.</p>
                <p>A crucial issue is for local communities, who have lived with and depended on the forests for
                centuries, to participate in designing REDD schemes and to benefit from them. REDD
                schemes will only work if it is clear who is to be compensated and how. For that reason it is
                important to strengthen the capacity of forest protection agencies to assure that the rewards
                for avoided deforestation reach the right people and do not just end up in the hands of
                corrupt officials, cattle ranchers, and palm oil and logging companies.</p>
                <p>A pre-emptive scheme for compensating those who have never deforested will be rather
                difficult to measure, but would be fairer. The Global Canopy Programme has proposed
                Proactive Investment in Natural Capital (PINC) as a complimentary framework to REDD.
                PINC would reward nations and landowners for the ecosystem services that protected
                forests provide. A critical issue is to work out the present value of the forests to be protected
                and this needs much careful thought and monetary calculation.</p>
                <h4>Reforestation benefits: carbon and timber</h4>
                <p>Currently the CDM under the Kyoto Treaty considers only afforestation and reforestation as
                acceptable carbon sequestration activities. Whilst it is widely accepted that protecting
                existing forests is much more effective for carbon storage than reforestation and the
                afforestation of degraded land, major tree planting initiatives are under way in different parts
                of the world. Reforestation certainly has an important additional role to play in countering the
                build-up of carbon in the atmosphere:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Carbon sequestration: New plantations can sequester carbon from the atmosphere at a
                rate of between 5 and 15 tonnes per hectare per year.</li>
                    <li>Timber supplies: Although reforestation can provide no substitute for the ecosystem
                services provided by primary forests, the world needs timber, and this demand should be
                met from plantations, not from the standing forest, wherever possible.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is important to point out that monoculture plantations of trees such as spruce or eucalyptus,
                which are to be grown on former forest land for the purpose of carbon sequestration, should
                not be encouraged by international policy. It seems important to restate that we must look
                beyond the role of forests as carbon sinks – they can provide many other important services,
                as we have seen above.</p>
                <p>There are some interesting examples of tree planting initiatives which set out to recreate
                natural forest ecosystems: ‘Analogue Forestry’, for instance, aims to reproduce the mixed
                multi-layered ecosystems that a diverse forest provides. And ‘agroforestry’, by which a
                variety of tree crops – including legumes – are produced on the same plot of land, is the
                most natural way of planting forests which can provide food, animal fodder and timber at the
                same time, whilst also capturing carbon from the air. Importantly, it can also help to restore
                the fertility of depleted soils for the benefit of local communities.</p>
                <h4>UNEP’s Billion Tree Campaign</h4>
                <p>Reforestation, and the afforestation of degraded land, takes great effort and major
                investments, and the financial returns have to be counted in decades rather than years.
                Nevertheless, very substantial tree planting efforts are now under way across the world.</p>
                <p>The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP’s) Billion Tree Campaign was
                launched in 2006 and is backed by Waangari Maathai, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and
                founder of Kenya’s Green Belt Movement (which initiated the planting of some 40 million
                trees in Kenya.) The Billion Trees Campaign has encouraged people all over the world –
                from private individuals and community groups, to businesses and governments – to plant
                anything from just a handful to several million trees. Initially the target was to plant one billion
                trees in 2007, but the success of the campaign has led to the much more ambitious goal of
                planting seven billion trees by the end of 2009. By December 2008 a total of 4.2 billion trees
                had been pledged and almost 2.6 billion planted.</p>
                <p>Speaking in February 2009, Wangari Maathai appealed to Heads of State around the world:
                "Imagine soldiers marching for the planet. While the armies of the world are waiting to fight
                an enemy that comes with a gun, we have another enemy, an unseen enemy, an enemy that
                is destroying our environment. The enemy that takes away our topsoil, takes away our
                waters, destroys our forests, destroys the air we breathe, clears the forest. This is the
                unseen enemy and it cannot be fought with a gun. This enemy can be fought with a tree. So
                you can imagine how wonderful it would be if every soldier on this planet started seeing
                himself and herself as a soldier for the planet, holding a gun on one side and a tree seedling
                on the other, to fight this unseen enemy which is actually more dangerous to us than the
                other enemy."</p>
                <p>In Africa, Ethiopia has become a major tree planting success story. In four decades,
                Ethiopia’s forest cover had dropped from 40 to just 2.7 percent. But spurred on by UNEP’s
                Billion Tree Campaign, Ethiopia has planted more trees than any other nation – some 700
                million in the last few years. Tewolde Egziabher, head of the country's Environmental
                Protection Authority, says that the combination of tree planting and development of organic
                farming has started to greatly improve the condition of rural communities in Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>China, too, has undertaken very large-scale tree planting schemes, talking of a ‘Great Green
                Wall.’ It has established 24 million hectares of new forests and natural forest regrowth – an
                area the size of the UK – to transform previously denuded landscapes, particularly in major
                watersheds, and has been able to offset some 21 percent of its fossil fuel emissions in 2000.
                28</p>
                <p>There are also major success stories from South America: Cuba has done much tree
                planting. Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, just 13.4 percent of the country was covered
                by trees. In the last 50 years the government's planting program has nearly doubled the
                national forest cover to some 25 percent. According to FAO, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile and
                Costa Rica are the four Latin American countries that have implemented very successful
                reforestation efforts. 29</p>
                <p>These examples are heartening, but much, much more needs to be done. Balancing forest
                protection and renewal, and philanthropy and profit, new ways must be found to safeguard
                and enhance the condition of the biosphere, the greatest climate regulation system we have
                at our disposal.</p>
                <p>Expanding bio-carbon sequestration projects beyond a few pilot schemes requires key
                measures: such as security of tenure, assured funding streams, political stability and
                institutional capacity. International carbon projects effectively represent an emerging market
                opportunity. Only those countries that are well prepared will be able to fully take advantage of
                this. 30</p>
                <h4>Farming carbon</h4>
                <p>The earth’s major natural sinks of CO2 are oceans, forests and, perhaps most importantly,
                soils. The global soil carbon pool is estimated to amount to 2,500 Gt (gigatons), whereas the
                biotic (vegetation-based) pool is 560 Gt 31 . What are options for carbon sequestration via
                soil renewal?</p>
                <p>A new international climate treaty needs to cast its net much wider than the Kyoto Treaty as
                regards bio-carbon sequestration. In addition to the inclusion of reforestation and forest
                conservation, soil carbon storage should be included as an eligible carbon sink. In fact, the
                IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report in 2007 indicated that carbon sequestration by improved
                soil management holds very significant mitigation potential. Whilst soils hold less carbon per
                hectare than forests, the carbon storage potential resulting from improved farming practices
                is very large indeed.</p>
                <p>The world’s total agricultural area is about 5 billion hectares, one billion more than for forests.
                Of this, about 1.5 billion ha (30 percent) is arable land and land under permanent crops, and
                the remaining 3.5 billion ha is permanent pasture. In addition, there are also up to 2.5 billion
                ha of rangelands.</p>
                <p>Soils naturally contain large amounts of carbon, derived from decayed vegetation. But the
                last few decades have seen a dramatic loss of top soil, soil carbon and inherent soil fertility
                due to unecological farming methods, and the one-way traffic of food supplies from rural
                areas to cities without the return of carbon back to farmland where the food was grown. An
                FAO report states that: “most agricultural soils have lost anything between 30 and 75 percent
                of their antecedent soil organic carbon pool, or a total of 30 to 40 t C ha. Carbon loss from
                soils is mainly associated with soil degradation … and has amounted to 78+/- 12 Gt since
                1850. Thus, the present organic carbon pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their
                potential capacity. … Considering all greenhouse gases, the global technical mitigation
                potential from agriculture is between 1.5 and 1.64 gigatonnes of carbon equivalent per year
                by 2030. Soil carbon sequestration is estimated to contribute about 89 percent to this
                mitigation potential”. 32</p>
                <p>All over the world soil and soil carbon (humus) is disappearing through erosion and through
                harvesting crops that end up being consumed in distant cities. In recent years there has been
                much talk about the world approaching ‘peak oil’, but perhaps even more importantly we
                have actually passed the point of 'peak soil' decades ago. All over the world topsoil is being
                lost on a massive scale. Says Professor David Pimentel of Cornell University: "Soil erosion is
                second only to population growth as the biggest environmental problem the world faces. Yet,
                the problem, which is growing ever more critical, is being ignored because who gets excited
                about dirt?" 33</p>
                <p>We urgently need international policy measures to restore soils to their previous levels of
                fertility and water holding capacity and to stop the ongoing release of carbon stored in soils,
                the world's second largest carbon sink, and potentially the world’s most effective carbon
                capture and storage system.</p>
                <p>The impacts of soil erosion and carbon loss on world food production have been masked to
                some extent by an ever-greater array of technologies used in farming which have produced
                higher yields – however unsustainably derived. But now we need to find ways to sequester
                much more carbon from the atmosphere by developing bold initiatives on renewing the
                world’s living systems, including life in the soil. It is time to find ways of replacing the one-way
                linear systems of resource depletion, consumption and pollution that have prevailed in the
                recent past with circular systems which can replenish nature and assure a sustainable
                human existence on earth.</p>
                <p>It is becoming apparent that the restoration of wastelands, degraded or desertified soils and
                ecosystems can dramatically enhance soil organic carbon content and soil quality. Such
                management practices include –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>organic farming</li>
                    <li>conservation tillage</li>
                    <li>application of mulch, manure and compost</li>
                    <li>use of cover crops</li>
                    <li>agroforestry practices</li>
                    <li>improved pastures management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Farmers need support to alleviate agriculture’s contribution to climate change by reducing
                tillage, increasing organic soil matter, improving grassland management, restoring degraded
                lands, planting trees and altering animal husbandry systems. 34 These sorts of practices not
                only enhance the fertility but also the water storage capacity of soils, and thereby increase
                farmland productivity. Restoration of soil organic matter can reverse farmland degradation,
                which is urgently needed in many parts of the world. Not only can this help increase food
                security, but its can also reduce the use of fossil fuels and its associated GHG emissions.</p>
                <p>The FAO states that soil carbon sequestration can take effect very quickly and is a cost-
                effective win-win approach which combines mitigation, adaptation, increased resilience and
                the promise of more reliable and increased crops yields.</p>
                <p>“Soil carbon storage was hitherto left out of international negotiations because of envisaged
                difficulties of validation of amounts and duration/permanency of sequestration. However, in
                addition to the undisputable multiple benefits of soil carbon storage, soil sampling for
                verification purposes is less expensive and more accurate than the indirect estimation of
                carbon stored in living biomass.</p>
                <p>The FAO has recently prepared a Global Carbon Gap Map that identifies land areas of high
                carbon sequestration potentials and is developing local land degradation assessment tools
                that includes a simple field measurement of soil carbon. FAO is also working on tools to
                measure, monitor and verify soil carbon pools and fluxes of greenhouse gas emissions from
                agricultural soils, including cropland, degraded land and pastures.”</p>
                <p>All in all, the potential for soil carbon sequestration is very large indeed and deserves to be
                incorporated into the post-Kyoto regime. 35 With populations expected to grow to nine billion
                by 2050, and with increasingly uncertain oil and water supplies, well-thought out new
                approaches to securing carbon-rich organic soils can help to secure the food supplies of
                future generations. We need policies to renew the world's soils in closed-loop, low-input
                farming systems based on a sustainable relationship between urban food consumers and
                rural farming communities.</p>
                <p>“Millions of farmers around the globe could become agents of change helping to reduce
                greenhouse gas emissions. … Agricultural land is able to store and sequester carbon.
                Farmers that live off the land, particularly in poor countries, should therefore be involved in
                carbon sequestration to mitigate the impact of climate change,” said Alexander Mueller, FAO
                Assistant Director-General at a conference in Bonn. 36</p>
                <p>A potential major additional benefit of measures to support soil quality and carbon
                sequestration could be to halt or even reverse migration from rural areas to the cities.
                Funding for enhanced soil carbon sequestration could thus have major environmental as well
                as economic and social benefits.</p>
                <h4>The promise of Biochar</h4>
                <p>In addition to measures for enriching farmland and pastures with ‘conventional’ organic
                matter, a very significant new option is becoming available under the heading of ‘Biochar’.
                This system term draws on ancient farming practices that have been used in the tropics.</p>
                <p>In 1542, the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana was the first European to travel down
                the Amazon River near Ecuador. While he never found El Dorado, the city of gold he was
                looking for, he found densely populated regions along the river. He reported that the jungle
                area held a sedentary farming population, with many large villages and towns, and even
                large, walled cities. The population levels he saw possibly exceeded even those of found in
                the Amazon region today. Sadly, the arrival of Europeans also introduced new diseases
                which appear to have wiped out a large part of the Indian population within decades.</p>
                <p>Because they used only wood as their construction material, the populations seen by
                Orellana and his companions did not create lasting monuments that visitors can see today,
                but they did leave behind dark, fertile soil in many river-side locations. The Amazonians of
                centuries ago appear to have produced charcoal by burning plant material in pits covered
                with earth. They then mixed this ‘biochar’ with organic wastes to create dark, fertile soil. This
                ‘terra preta’ can still be found across the Amazon basin - some 60 locations with deep rich,
                dark soil often containing pottery fragments have so far been identified. 37</p>
                <p>Amazonian Indians today still produce charcoal by burning areas of forest to turn them into
                gardens in a process called slash-burn agriculture. But the ash produced in this way is
                mainly left on top of the soil and not dug in and neither is it mixed with organic wastes. The
                people from the river-side settlements seen by Orellana are long gone, but the dark, deep,
                fertile soil they cultivated over thousands of years remains.</p>
                <p>Terra Preta soils contain far more charcoal then soil found elsewhere in the Amazon.
                Scientific research has shown that the porous quality of the biochar these soils contain
                allows them to harbour a vast variety and quantity of soil microrganisms. The biochar
                particles can be retained in the soil for centuries and they can improve soil structure,
                enhance the presence of micro-organisms and plant nutrients. In addition, adding biochar to
                the soil not only enhances fertility and life in the soil, but also helps it to retain moisture –
                which is very important in an age of climate change.</p>
                <p>Research into biochar started in Holland in the 1960s and there are now hundreds of
                research programmes into various aspects of biochar across the world. A recent book,
                ‘Biochar for Environmental Management – Science and Technology’, edited by Prof.
                Johannes Lehmann, is a state-of-the-art compilation about all aspects of biochar written by
                some 50 researchers. Tim Flannery , the eminent Australian naturalist, and a member of the
                World Future Council, states this in his foreword: “This book, I believe, provides the basic
                information required to implement the single most important initiative for humanity’s
                environmental future. The biochar approach provides a uniquely powerful solution: it allows
                us to address food security, the fuel crisis and the climate problem, and all in an immensely
                practical manner. Biochar is both an extremely ancient concept and one very new to our
                thinking. … Yet few farmers living today have heard about biochar.” 38</p>
                <p>’Modern biochar’ is produced by pyrolysis (low-oxygen combustion) of organic materials –
                forest thinnings, sawdust, agricultural wastes, urban organic wastes or sewage solids – and
                the resulting charcoal-like substance can be incorporated into farmland as a long-term
                carbon storage option. Importantly, Biochar is also claimed to convert carbon from the
                atmosphere into stored carbon in soil. Unlike natural decay or the combustion of organic
                matter, the pyrolysis process releases only a fraction of the carbon content of the source
                material into the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>By ‘pyrolysing’ one tonne of organic material which contains half a tonne of carbon, about
                half a tonne of CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil whilst the
                other half can be used as a carbon-neutral fuel (this equals a quarter of the CO2 absorbed
                by the plant during its growth). Biochar has the potential to lock the mineral carbon it contains
                safely away in the soil for centuries. In addition, the ancillary benefits – not just its soil-
                improving characteristics, but certain by-products of its manufacture – make it economically
                attractive as well.</p>
                <p>Research has shown that Biochar can last hundreds to even thousands of years in the soil. It
                can change soil properties favourably, and help deliver nutrients to plants better than in soil
                that has not been treated. An ever-growing number of researchers now suggest that Biochar-
                in-soil practices could be the most cost effective means of reducing carbon in both the
                atmosphere and oceans.</p>
                <p>Professor Johannes Lehmann of Cornell University and others have calculated that biochar
                could remove between 5.5 and 9.5 gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere each year. But
                those estimates relied on the optimistic assumption that sufficient source material can be
                found to make biochar. A more widely accepted view is that biochar applications to soil could
                remove one to two billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere per year. 39</p>
                <p>A major question that needs an urgent answer is how enough organic matter can be made
                available to produce significant amounts of biochar. Opponents argue that farming
                communities in developing countries may be forced to produce fast growing tree
                monocultures on precious agricultural land to produce biochar to counter climate change for
                which they are not even responsible. It is certainly true that unlike in Amazonia centuries ago
                there is not likely to be much spare biomass available to produce the amounts of biochar that
                may be needed to make a significant difference.</p>
                <p>Just how can large quantities of biochar be produced? To find an answer to this question it is
                worth having a look at the sewage works in Bingen, Germany. Here semi-dried sewage
                sludge is fed via a conveyor belt into a steel container where it is pyrolysed and turned into
                glittering black granules: the sewage is turned into charcoal. This can then be buried in farm
                soil and prevented from entering the atmosphere. At the Bingen University of Applied
                Sciences Dr. Helmut Gerber, the head of the research project, is convinced of the enormous
                potential of sewage-derived biochar. 40</p>
                <h4>The potential of salt water crop irrigation</h4>
                <p>Another new option for carbon storage and additional production of food and timber of great
                significance is the use of saltwater tolerant plants, such as mangroves and salicorna shrubs.
                Scientists estimate that saltwater-loving plants could open up half a million square miles of
                previously unusable territory for crops whilst helping to settle the heated food-versus-fuel
                debate of recent years. By increasing the world's irrigated acreage by 50 percent, saltwater
                crops could provide a valuable additional source of biomass.</p>
                <p>In a recent issue of Science Magazine, two plant biologists argued that "the increasing
                demand for agricultural products and the spread of salinity now make this concept worth
                serious consideration and investment."</p>
                <p>Glenn has been arguing for the value of saltwater farming for nearly thirty years, for both
                food and fuel production. Glenn’s team estimates that salt-loving crops could be used to
                produce 1.5 billion barrels of ethanol annually on a swathe of new agricultural land almost
                five times the size of Texas.</p>
                <p>Says Glenn: "I'm convinced that saltwater agriculture is going to open up a whole new
                expanse of land and water for crop production. Maybe the world hasn't needed a 50 percent
                expansion in irrigated agricultural land because we've had enough food, but now that biofuels
                are in the mix, I think it's the way crop production should go."</p>
                <p>There's plenty of previously uncultivated land in the world's coastal deserts and these could
                play an important role in crop and fuel production. Glenn estimates that 480,000 square
                miles of unused land around the world could be used to grow salt-tolerant plants, or
                halophytes. While salt damages most plants, these salt-loving plants actually use the
                saltwater to draw in fresh water. In essence, they make themselves saltier than the
                surrounding water, which, through osmosis, drives fresh water into the plant. One particular
                plant, Salicornia, produces 1.7 times more oil per acre than sunflowers, a common source of
                vegetable oil.</p>
                <p>Halophytes could also be part of the solution to another environmental problem: heavily-
                salinated wastewater from large farms. Right now, this is dumped into manmade wetlands.
                For example, in California, the Imperial Valley authorities dump their salty water into the
                Salton Sea. After absorbing 80 years of agricultural runoff, the Salton Sea is 25 percent
                saltier than the ocean, and is facing serious ecological problems. Instead of pumping
                salinized water into these wetlands, the farms could capture that wastewater and use it to
                grow halophytes.</p>
                <p>But even if halophytes can help solve some of the world's environmental problems, one has
                to be realistic about the difficulties of changing agricultural systems. Says Glenn: "I started in
                aquaculture back in the early 70s and we thought, golly, aquaculture is going to save the
                world. Looking back, it's been 35 years, but over half of the key fisheries products come from
                aquaculture, it just took longer than people thought," Glenn said. "I think it's the same thing
                with saline crop production." 41</p>
                <p>In addition to salicornia, it would be possible to replant mangroves in estuaries and marine
                shorelines where they have been cut down, in areas affected by salinisation or in places that
                are deliberately flooded with saltwater or brackish water. Mangroves are found in tropical and
                sub-tropical tidal areas that have a high degree of salinity. There are about 110 species of
                mangroves, and apart from the benefit of their rapid growth they are also provide habitats for
                a great variety of living species, and act as nurseries for fish and other marine species.
                Layers of soil and peat which make up the mangrove substrate have a high carbon content
                of 10 percent or more, and a hectare of mangrove forest can sequester about 1.5 tonnes of
                carbon per year. 42</p>
                <h4>The trouble with the oceans</h4>
                <p>The oceans of the world absorb about one third of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from
                the burning of fossil fuels - mainly through the growth of plankton. However, this valuable
                ecological service comes at a high price – the acidification of the oceans. When CO2
                dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid and the pH of the water decreases as a result.
                Since the industrial revolution began, it is estimated that surface ocean pH has dropped by
                slightly less than 0.1 units, equating to approximately a 25 percent increase in acidity. This
                rate of change is a great cause for concern as there is no evidence that the world’s oceans
                have ever experienced such a rapid a process of acidification. By the end of this century, pH
                could be three times lower and the change could be 100 times faster than that experienced
                during the transitions from glacial to interglacial periods. 43 The effects of ocean acidification
                are predicted to put maritime ecosystems at major risk and there is an emerging consensus
                that the average pH of surface waters should be prevented from dropping by more than 0.2
                units below the pre-industrial value. 44</p>
                <p>While the full ecological consequences of these changes are still uncertain, it appears likely
                that many calcifying species, such as corals and shell fish, will be affected. This could have
                adverse effects on climate change, both by reducing the bio-capacity of the oceans and by
                decreasing the earth's albedo via the effect of their bio-productivity on oceanic cloud cover.
                Global reductions of carbon emissions, with simultaneous efforts to enhance the capacity of
                the terrestrial biosphere to absorb carbon, are clearly urgently called for.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile there are other aspects of what is happening to the oceans that have received
                much less attention. The massive growth of cities along rivers and in coastal regions all over
                the world has also led to a tremendous increase in the discharge of sewage into coastal
                waters. This represents a tremendous transfer of both carbon and soil fertility from rural
                areas into the sea. All over the world polluted coastal waters cloud sea bed vegetation,
                reducing its bio-productivity. At the same time, algal blooms remove oxygen from the water
                and further affect its productivity.</p>
                <p>It seems evident that vigorous efforts to clean up coastal water and to enhance their bio-
                productivity need to be considered as an integral part of any strategy to enhance the bio-
                sequestration capacity of planet earth. Together with initiatives to reduce the acidification of
                the oceans, these are matters that need to be addressed urgently. 45</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Given the many variables involved, it was beyond the scope of this chapter to add up
                precisely which measures of biosphere and soil restoration will add up to the sequestration of
                specific amounts of greenhouse gases. Certainly, major investments combining forest
                protection, reforestation, soil enhancement and coastal water restoration – for the purpose of
                removing and storing carbon from the atmosphere – need to be conceptualised very carefully
                indeed. Significant new policy measures and financial flows to rural areas and communities
                will be needed to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
                <p>This message has not been lost on scientific entrepreneurs who are putting forward all kinds
                of fancy solutions for coming to the aid of the planet: genetically engineered eucalyptus, pine
                trees and oil palms, the Super Kiri tree, the kenaf plant, and jatropha and other ‘miracle
                crops’ are being proposed both for carbon sequestration and alternatives to fossil fuels. But
                rarely is the question being addressed where the water and plant nutrients needed for
                growing vast acreages of super-fast growing monocultures are likely to come from.</p>
                <p>It is a major challenge for the international community to come up with suitable funding
                mechanisms for level-headed bio-sequestration in all the various forms in a new Kyoto
                Treaty. Many carbon off-set schemes are already available – both commercial and non-
                commercial. The successor to the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto
                Agreement, which is intended to transfer funds from developed to developing countries for
                the benefit of climate protection, must incorporate proposals that benefit both local
                communities as well as the global human community. By initiating well thought-out measures
                to improve the carbon sequestration potential of the biosphere we will also be investing in the
                sustainability and viability of rural communities in the face of rampant urbanisation.</p>
                <p>In the 1930s President Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps to ‘conserve our
                natural resources and create future natural wealth.’ Today an Earth Corps could be set up for
                a similar purpose and provide meaningful work for people who want to dedicate themselves
                to restoring the health of our planet for future generations.</p>
