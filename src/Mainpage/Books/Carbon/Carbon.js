                <h3>Carbon and the biosphere</h3>
                <p className="chapterDescription">This is a slightly abridged version of the second chapter of Herbert Girardet &
                Miguel Mendonca, ‘A Renewable World’, Green Books, Dartington, 2009, a report
                to the World Future Council</p>
                <p>There is growing scientific evidence that to avoid a climate catastrophe in the coming
                decades we need not just to reduce carbon emissions, but, beyond that, to reduce actual
                concentrations of CO2 already present in the earth’s atmosphere. This is an agenda that
                goes significantly beyond the targets currently being pursued by the world’s ‘climate
                guardians’ such the IPCC.</p>
                <p>Jim Hansen, the eminent climate researcher and director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, has indicated that the IPCC has been much too cautious in its assessments
and that we are rapidly reaching crucial tipping points which compel us to act very rapidly
indeed to prevent run-away climate change. In an interview published in 2008 he said this:</p>
<p>“Recent greenhouse gas emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate
change ... There is already enough carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere for massive ice sheets
such as West Antarctica to eventually melt away, and ensure that sea levels will rise metres
in coming decades. Climate zones such as the tropics and temperate regions will continue to
shift, and the oceans will become more acidic, endangering much marine life. We must begin
to move rapidly to the post-fossil fuel clean energy system. Moreover, we must remove some
carbon that has collected in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.” 1</p>
<p>Hansen’s views have been reinforced by alarming news about melting mountain glaciers and
by the unprecedented thinning of polar ice, with the prospect that summer ice in the Arctic
may largely disappear in a matter of years. Far more solar energy will be absorbed into the
arctic oceans as their colour turns dark as ice dissolves during the summer months. This and
other positive feedbacks are the alarm signals of an unprecedented crisis that have led the
Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon to refer to a global climate emergency.</p>
<p>So, where do we go from here? By 2009 global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have
already reached 387 parts per million (ppm), up by 40 per cent from 275 ppm in 1900. Until
recently a doubling to 550 ppm was widely regarded as acceptable, but this was revised
downwards to some 450 ppm as new scientific evidence about a warming planet emerged.
Now most climatologists are profoundly concerned about even this seemingly small increase,
and argue for an actual reduction of CO2 concentrations to 350 ppm or below. This goes way
beyond scenarios currently being proposed by governments in developed countries.</p>
<p>The problem is that every year we are now discharging nearly 10 billion tonnes of carbon into
the atmosphere. Of this, four to five billion tonnes are not being reabsorbed into the world’s
ecosystems, but are accumulating in the atmosphere. Are there possibilities to absorb
surplus greenhouse gas emissions, and, beyond that, to find ways to actually reduce existing
GHG concentrations?</p>
<p>There has been much talk about the potential of removing carbon by technical means
through carbon capture and storage, or geo-sequestration. Yet even if CCS were to succeed
on a substantial scale, it will not deal with carbon already present in the atmosphere. We
need alternative approaches, and particularly bio-sequestration, which can deal with new
emissions as well as existing CO2 concentrations – if done on a large enough scale.</p>
<p>For global temperatures to stabilise, carbon emissions must ultimately not exceed what can
be absorbed by the biosphere, the Earth's vegetation, soils and oceans. So, can we find
ways to enhance the capacity of the biosphere to absorb CO2?</p>
<p>There is no question that this is a controversial issue, particularly regarding the idea of using
reforestation for carbon sequestration purposes. For instance, in a joint statement in 2006
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and WWF-UK strongly argued against ‘reforestation sink
projects’, mainly because “large-scale monoculture tree plantations often have negative
impacts on the environment and forest communities”. 2</p>
<p>A number of other publications detail the perceived fallacy of carbon offsets. A report called
‘The Carbon Neutral Myth – Offset Indulgences for your Climate Sins,’ rails against the idea
of people in the rich countries obtaining ‘permission’ to burn oil, gas and coal by paying for
carbon offsets – more often than not by tree planting projects somewhere in the Global South
where “projects are being imposed on communities with little consultation.” 3</p>
<p>These objections certainly must be taken seriously. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the need
to find ways of enhancing the capacity of the earth’s living environment to absorb carbon. Not
only can this help to reduce atmospheric carbon concentrations but, if done right, it can also
increase the options for sustainable food and timber production for a growing global
population. In a world challenged by climate change and biodiversity loss as well as hunger,
it is critically important to undertake new initiatives which can have such multiple benefits.</p>
<p>A key point to be considered is that whilst fossil fuel burning has massively increased in the
last 300 years, the capacity of the biosphere to absorb it has been significantly reduced at
the same time: A frequently quoted figure is that 200 to 250 billions tons of carbon have been
lost from the biosphere in the last 300 years. This resulted from -</p>
<ol>
    <li>deforestation</li>
    <li>biodiversity loss</li>
    <li>accelerated soil erosion</li>
    <li>loss of soil organic matter</li>
    <li>salinisation of soils</li>
    <li>costal water pollution and</li>
    <li>acidification of the oceans</li>
</ol>
<p>A key argument we need to use is that carbon dioxide should be regarded not simply as a
bad that has to be stored in underground caverns out of harm’s way, but that it can be turned
into a good that can be used to enhance the wellbeing of the biosphere and humanity. All
living beings are primarily made of carbon. Can the disruptive human impact on nature’s
carbon cycle, which is causing ever worsening instabilities, be brought back into balance by
deliberate action?</p>
<h4>A matter of balance</h4>
<p>A healthy balance sheet matches income and outgoings – in fact, on the balance sheet of a
thriving company or household, income exceeds outgoings. But not so in the world’s global
carbon balance sheet: year after year we have been running up ever greater deficits. For
instance, WWF’s annual Living Planet Reports indicate clearly that in our dealings with
nature we have been creating ever greater imbalances. The annual WWF Living Planet
Reports tell us that we are consuming the resources that underpin the world’s ecosystems
services much faster than they are being replenished. Humanity’s global ecological footprint
now exceeds the world’s capacity to regenerate by about 30 percent. 4 Indisputably, this
state of affairs cannot continue.</p>
<p>The main constituent of life on earth is carbon, drawn from carbon dioxide in the earth’s
atmosphere. It is the chemical basis of all known life, and forms more compounds than any
other element, with some ten million so far identified by science. Variations in carbon dioxide
levels in the atmosphere have been known for some time to influence the impact of solar
radiation on the earth, and with that, the earth’s climate. Around 2,000 gigatonnes of carbon
are present in the world’s soils and vegetation and have been fairly constant over the last few
million years. The earth’s remaining fossil fuel reserves amount to approximately 1,200
gigatonnes, or 1.2 trillion tonnes. Around 900 gigatonnes of these are coal, and the
remaining oil and gas reserves each amount to around 150 gigatonnes. 5</p>
<p>Over the course of some 300 million years, carbon was drawn down by living organisms from
the atmosphere and ‘relocated’ in the earth’s crust, ultimately becoming fossil fuels. These
were formed out of biomass that was deposited on the ocean floor by sea organisms, by
organic particles that were washed into the sea, and out of plant and animal matter on land
which was then covered over by sediments and more decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>In the last 300 years we have reversed this process of biological carbon sequestration, and
have transferred hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon back into the atmosphere, with
increasingly dire consequences. How can we balance the books? How can humanity re-
establish a carbon cycle where income and outgoings are matched?</p>
<p>This matter is addressed in some detail by the IPCC reports published in recent years, and
some mitigation measures have been agreed by the international community. However, new
thinking about how large amounts of carbon already present in the atmosphere can be
sequestered is now urgently needed.</p>
<p>According to the Global Carbon Project, the land and ocean carbon sinks – such as forests
and plankton in the ocean – removed about 54 percent, or 4.8 billion tonnes a year of the
carbon that humans discharged into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2007. That leaves a
carbon surplus of about 4 billion tonnes or so per year, which we need to find ways to reduce
or absorb. 6</p>
<p>We must take a new look at how better land-use and forest management can further
enhance biological carbon sequestration. There has been much discussion about the
feasibility of geo-sequestration of CO2 from power stations, refineries, etc. However, there is
little doubt now we should prioritise biological carbon capture and storage (BCCS), or bio-
sequestration, through deliberate measures of forest protection, reforestation and the
improvement of soil by incorporation of compost and ‘biochar’.</p>
<p>In this context it is important to realise that well thought out bio-sequestration has multiple
benefits to nature and human society: in addition to absorbing surplus carbon, it also offers
significant opportunities for biodiversity protection, soil erosion prevention and, potentially,
enhanced food production and poverty reduction in rural areas. This could even help to
enhance the economic viability of rural communities in an age in which billions of people
have been forced to move to cities for a better life/ to earn a better living.</p>
<h4>Forests for life</h4>
<p>Global forest cover extends to nearly 4 billion hectares, or 30 percent of the world’s land
surface. 7 The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recently done a Forest
Resources Assessment which states that the world’s forests contain 638 gigatonnes of
carbon – which is more than the total carbon contained in the atmosphere. 8</p>
<p>Forest ecosystems are crucially important components of the global carbon cycle in several
ways. They remove some 3 billion tonnes of carbon every year through net growth,
absorbing nearly 30 percent of all C02 emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation. 9</p>
<p>Healthy forests also play a crucial role as global ecological life-support systems. Reports
such as UNEP’s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment make it clear that the goods and
services provided by forests are worth trillions of dollars to the global economy. In addition to
carbon sequestration, they provide a wide range of ‘ecosystem services’ of benefit to all life:
they are wildlife habitats, biodiversity centres, climate regulators and watershed protectors –
not to mention medicine cabinets and cosmetics counters. These services are effectively of
no cost to human society, and they are absent from humanity’s balance sheet and their
critical contributions to the viability of life on earth are largely overlooked in decision-making.
This problem needs to be urgently addressed: we need to recognise forests as important
natural assets with economic and social value and do what is necessary to promote their
protection and regeneration. 10</p>
<p>As human populations and their economies grow, so do the resource demands imposed on
ecosystems and the impacts of our collective, global ecological footprint. But society is
coming to realise that as ecosystem services are threatened across the world, there is an
urgent need to evaluate both their immediate and their long-term benefits to humanity.
Increasingly, researchers have been able to quantify the economic value associated with
ecosystem services based on assessing the cost of replacing these with ‘man-made’
alternatives. 11</p>

<h4>Deforestation, a global problem</h4>
<p>Deforestation, particularly in the tropics, has long been regarded as a major environmental
problem. It is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions and one of the
primary contributors to climate change. The IPCC estimates that is responsible for 18 to 20
percent of global carbon emissions. Deforestation today is concentrated in a few developing
countries, primarily in the tropics, but countries all over the world will ultimately benefit from
forest protection. So, new international forest conservation efforts are urgently needed.</p>
<p>According to the FAO, between 2000 and 2005, the global annual net loss of forest area was
7.3 million hectares per year, mainly in the tropics. 12 Given that tropical forests absorb about
500 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, this represents a loss of CO2 sequestration capacity of 3.65
billion tonnes. 13 As well as being a major threat to the climate, deforestation also affects 1.6
billion of the world’s poorest people who directly depend on forests for their survival. 14
Processes of deforestation vary from continent to continent. In South America it is driven
primarily by logging and the expansion of large-scale farming, primarily to produce beef and
Soybeans; in South East Asia forests are being cleared primarily for timber production and
for the expansion of oil palm and coffee for global markets.</p>
<p>The economic impacts of deforestation are immense. A 2008 study headed by Deutsche
Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev, entitled The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity
(TEEB), estimates that destruction of forests internationally is causing economic damage to
the tune of $2 to $5 trillion, or up to seven percent of the global economy, annually. This
calculation was done by placing value on the various services that healthy forests provide for
free, such as carbon sequestration, food supply and water storage. Sukhdev emphasises
that the cost of this decline dwarfs the recent losses on the financial markets. "It's not only
greater but it's also continuous, it's been happening every year, year after year.” 15</p>
<p>The Global Canopy Programme (GCP) – an alliance of 37 scientific institutions in 19
countries – is a world leader in forest canopy research, education and conservation. The
programme proposes realistic new ways of compensating countries and companies for
protecting their forests, in their own interest as well as the interest of the world community.</p>
<p>Andrew Mitchell, director of GCP, says that tropical rainforests are the ‘elephant in the living
room of climate change’. 16 In other words, their presence may be overwhelmingly obvious,
but few people know how to deal with it. His perspective is supported by the 2006 Stern
Review which states that deforestation from 2008-2012 will be responsible for more
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than aviation since the invention of the aeroplane until at
least 2025. It says that curbing deforestation should be regarded as a highly cost-effective
way of reducing GHG emissions. 17</p>
<h4>A view from the Amazon</h4>
<p>In its entirety the Amazon Basin covers some 7 million square kilometres. The lion’s share,
some 5 million square kilometres, is in Brazil, and the remainder stretches across eight other
countries. At least 60 percent of the world’s remaining tropical rainforests, with their
unsurpassed biodiversity - including some 55,000 different plant species - are to be found in
the Amazon. Moreover, the forests in the Amazon Basin contain at least one-fifth the
equivalent of all the carbon currently in the atmosphere, and recent studies show that intact
Amazonian forests are also functioning as a globally significant carbon sink, even absorbing
some of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from industrial emissions. 18</p>
<p>Deforestation for logging, cattle ranching, Soybean production, mining and smallholder
farming has so far affected about 20 percent of the Amazon forest, with the greatest impacts
in the eastern and southern Amazon. Major concerns are not only carbon loss as a result of
deforestation, but also changes in the moisture transfer across vast areas.</p>
<p>The Amazon basin is an enormous heat engine, taking heat from the sun, turning it into
water vapour and powering tropical air circulation. It has been shown through modelling by
two Russian climate scientists that the multi-layered canopy of rainforests is ideal for the
transfer of water through cloud formation over long distances – the so-called ‘River in the
Sky. For instance, the only way water will transfer from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes is
through the canopy of the Amazon rainforest. 19</p>
<p>A report “Drought Sensitivity of the Amazon Rainforest” published by Science Magazine in
March 2009, presents evidence that the Amazon rainforest is very sensitive to drought –
which is likely to intensify under global warming. The 25 year study, which involved some 68
scientists, has used the severe drought that struck the Amazon in September 2005 as a
”unique opportunity to directly evaluate the large-scale sensitivity of tropical forest to water
deficits”. The study concluded that drought causes massive carbon loss in the forest - mainly
through killing trees that were not able to tolerate the drier soil conditions. 20</p>
<p>The researchers found that the Amazon forest normally absorbs nearly 2 billion tonnes of
carbon dioxide each year, but in 2005 the dry conditions caused it to lose more than 3 billion
tonnes of living biomass. “The total impact of the drought - 5 billion extra tonnes of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere - exceeds the annual emissions of Europe and Japan combined”,
stated the press release from Leeds University, which led the research.</p>
<p>Covering the research in The Independent newspaper, Steve Connor wrote: “The Amazon
has long been the lungs of the world. But now comes dramatic evidence that we cannot rely
on it in the fight against climate change”. 21</p>
<p>Since the 2005 drought, the Brazilian government had some success in lowering the rate of
deforestation. In 2006 deforestation was reduced by some 30 percent and all seemed to be
going well. However in 2007, with the growing interest in biofuels and rising food prices
(which was also partly because of biofuels) deforestation rates shot up again and it was clear
that the government did not have deforestation under control. It remains to be seen whether
the current world recession has reduced deforestation rates once again.</p>
<p>While scientists and climatologists are hesitant about making predictions too far into the
future, many believe that the forest system, particularly in the Eastern Amazon, is
dangerously close to collapse and that drought could occur regularly in the coming years,
with dire consequences for the area beyond, which depends on the Amazon for its rainfall.
Brazilian hydrologists have shown that the Amazon basin evaporates some 20 billion tonnes
of water daily and that the standing forest helps to lower surface air temperatures through
evaporation. This evaporative cooling and the resulting recycling of water is crucial for all the
other services provided by the forests, including carbon storage.</p>
<p>Many scientists now think that we are approaching a critical point, certainly in the East
Amazon. If the forest system were to collapse, this would disrupt huge energy and moisture
flows which would have a ‘shockwave’ effect across the world’s climate systems. 22</p>
<h4>New demands for forest products</h4>
<p>Africa’s Congo Basin Forest, the largest expanse of tropical forest outside the Amazon, is
coming under huge pressure from international timber markets. This is epitomised by a story
from the environment editor of the Guardian newspaper John Vidal, who visited the region in
2007 to write about the logging operations there. In a saw mill he saw several huge trees
being cut up and when he asked where the timber was going to end up, the answer was: at
the cycle track being built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>
<p>Rapidly growing economies such as China are scouring the world for timber and other forest
products. China now buys 55 percent of the Republic of Congo’s timber exports which come
almost entirely from virgin forests. 23 Increasingly, not only timber but also palm oil and
soybeans are being imported from ecologically vulnerable rainforest regions. Malaysia is
supplying ever-growing amounts of palm oil from converted rainforests. In 2006 it exported
some 14.4 million tonnes of palm oil and of this China imported nearly 3.6 million tonnes. 24
In the last 20 years China has become the world's largest importer of whole Soybeans as
well as oil and meal by-products. 25 Brazilian Soy exports to China, mainly from the Amazon
and former savannah regions in Mato Grosso, increased from one million tons to four million
tons between 1999 and 2003. 26</p>
<p>“What if China reaches the U.S. consumption level per person?” asks Lester Brown, CEO of
the Earth Policy Institute. “If China’s economy continues to expand at eight percent a year, its
income per person will reach the current U.S. level in 2031. If at that point China’s per capita
resource consumption were the same as in the United States today, then its projected 1.45
billion people would consume the equivalent of two thirds of the current world grain harvest.
China’s paper consumption would be double the world’s current production. There go the
world’s forests.” 27</p>
<p>It is, however, important to point out that China is only following in the footsteps of Europe,
the US and Japan whose demands have been the primary contributor to deforestation in the
tropics until recently, and this continues today despite substantial efforts by environmental
lobbies such as the FSC to certify timber and other tropical forests products. We certainly
need some new strategies to protect and renew forests around the world.</p>
<h4>Ecosystem services and avoided deforestation</h4>
<p>The fact the 1997 Kyoto agreement did not address the need to reduce emissions from
deforestation is a major problem. This was partly due to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the
emissions involved. The negotiators initially had difficulties with the measuring of emissions
and setting suitable baselines, but this has since been rectified. In 1997 there was also a
major concern that the sheer scale of carbon credits produced from ‘avoided deforestation’
would tend to undermine incentives to reduce emissions by other sectors. As a result of
these factors, reforestation projects were included in the agreement, but ‘avoided
deforestation’ was left out.</p>
<p>Today, technological advances such as satellite monitoring technology, have given us
accurate measures of both annual forest losses and carbon emissions from deforestation.
The notion that avoided deforestation should be included within international carbon markets
is now being hotly debated. Many experts feel that without schemes for compensating
developing countries for avoided deforestation, any post-Kyoto climate deal will not be able
to achieve the global emissions reductions necessary to combat climate change.</p>
<p>The Global Canopy Programme says that it is crucial to acknowledge that living forests
provide valuable climatic services that deforested areas cannot provide, and the overall
economic value we place on forests needs to reflect this. Thus the only way to curb further
deforestation is to put a price on carbon contained in forests and so provide an incentive for
developing countries to protect them.</p>
<p>New financial incentives are important because the efforts of NGOs to reduce deforestation
by appealing to the environmental and social responsibility of producers and consumers
have so far had only limited success. Philanthropy has also been on an inadequate scale to
deal with such a huge task. The urgency of the climate challenge means we must develop
more effective and innovative methods of international cooperation to curb deforestation.</p>
<p>There is a complex set of factors behind deforestation and they have to be well understood
for any policy framework to be successful. The primary reason is that presently the
conversion of forest to other land uses such as farming, plantations and mining is usually
more profitable, particularly if it is supported by government policies, subsidies and
international trade. Poorly defined property rights, non-transparency, financial gain by elites
and weak law enforcement are other causes of deforestation. Any alternative policies
intended to counter deforestation must deal with this complex set of issues.</p>
<p>Experts agree that ecosystems - and especially tropical rainforests - must be a central part of
any post-Kyoto agreement - because it is the most immediate and cost effective way to
achieve real and significant reductions in GHG emissions. There is now growing consensus
that financial compensation for avoided deforestation is the best way to reduce loss of
forests, particularly in the tropics.</p>
<h4>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)</h4>
<p>Since 2005 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has
been trying to create a new international policy framework to counter deforestation. REDD
has been developed largely as a result of initiatives by developing countries, led by Costa
Rica and Papua New Guinea. It is intended to enable these countries to earn credits for
‘avoided deforestation’. The idea is that developing countries which protect their forests,
which can therefore continue to provide essential ecosystem services for the world, should
be compensated for doing so. If REDD is to be part of a post-2012 climate deal, agreement
must be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
<p>If REDD is to work effectively it needs to address carbon emissions, biodiversity, ecosystem
services and rural poverty alleviation all at the same time. Above all else, it must help assure
sustainable livelihoods of forest-dependent communities.</p>
<p>A crucial issue is for local communities, who have lived with and depended on the forests for
centuries, to participate in designing REDD schemes and to benefit from them. REDD
schemes will only work if it is clear who is to be compensated and how. For that reason it is
important to strengthen the capacity of forest protection agencies to assure that the rewards
for avoided deforestation reach the right people and do not just end up in the hands of
corrupt officials, cattle ranchers, and palm oil and logging companies.</p>
<p>A pre-emptive scheme for compensating those who have never deforested will be rather
difficult to measure, but would be fairer. The Global Canopy Programme has proposed
Proactive Investment in Natural Capital (PINC) as a complimentary framework to REDD.
PINC would reward nations and landowners for the ecosystem services that protected
forests provide. A critical issue is to work out the present value of the forests to be protected
and this needs much careful thought and monetary calculation.</p>
<h4>Reforestation benefits: carbon and timber</h4>
<p>Currently the CDM under the Kyoto Treaty considers only afforestation and reforestation as
acceptable carbon sequestration activities. Whilst it is widely accepted that protecting
existing forests is much more effective for carbon storage than reforestation and the
afforestation of degraded land, major tree planting initiatives are under way in different parts
of the world. Reforestation certainly has an important additional role to play in countering the
build-up of carbon in the atmosphere:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Carbon sequestration: New plantations can sequester carbon from the atmosphere at a
rate of between 5 and 15 tonnes per hectare per year.</li>
    <li>Timber supplies: Although reforestation can provide no substitute for the ecosystem
services provided by primary forests, the world needs timber, and this demand should be
met from plantations, not from the standing forest, wherever possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to point out that monoculture plantations of trees such as spruce or eucalyptus,
which are to be grown on former forest land for the purpose of carbon sequestration, should
not be encouraged by international policy. It seems important to restate that we must look
beyond the role of forests as carbon sinks – they can provide many other important services,
as we have seen above.</p>
<p>There are some interesting examples of tree planting initiatives which set out to recreate
natural forest ecosystems: ‘Analogue Forestry’, for instance, aims to reproduce the mixed
multi-layered ecosystems that a diverse forest provides. And ‘agroforestry’, by which a
variety of tree crops – including legumes – are produced on the same plot of land, is the
most natural way of planting forests which can provide food, animal fodder and timber at the
same time, whilst also capturing carbon from the air. Importantly, it can also help to restore
the fertility of depleted soils for the benefit of local communities.</p>
<h4>UNEP’s Billion Tree Campaign</h4>
<p>Reforestation, and the afforestation of degraded land, takes great effort and major
investments, and the financial returns have to be counted in decades rather than years.
Nevertheless, very substantial tree planting efforts are now under way across the world.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP’s) Billion Tree Campaign was
launched in 2006 and is backed by Waangari Maathai, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and
founder of Kenya’s Green Belt Movement (which initiated the planting of some 40 million
trees in Kenya.) The Billion Trees Campaign has encouraged people all over the world –
from private individuals and community groups, to businesses and governments – to plant
anything from just a handful to several million trees. Initially the target was to plant one billion
trees in 2007, but the success of the campaign has led to the much more ambitious goal of
planting seven billion trees by the end of 2009. By December 2008 a total of 4.2 billion trees
had been pledged and almost 2.6 billion planted.</p>
<p>Speaking in February 2009, Wangari Maathai appealed to Heads of State around the world:
"Imagine soldiers marching for the planet. While the armies of the world are waiting to fight
an enemy that comes with a gun, we have another enemy, an unseen enemy, an enemy that
is destroying our environment. The enemy that takes away our topsoil, takes away our
waters, destroys our forests, destroys the air we breathe, clears the forest. This is the
unseen enemy and it cannot be fought with a gun. This enemy can be fought with a tree. So
you can imagine how wonderful it would be if every soldier on this planet started seeing
himself and herself as a soldier for the planet, holding a gun on one side and a tree seedling
on the other, to fight this unseen enemy which is actually more dangerous to us than the
other enemy."</p>
<p>In Africa, Ethiopia has become a major tree planting success story. In four decades,
Ethiopia’s forest cover had dropped from 40 to just 2.7 percent. But spurred on by UNEP’s
Billion Tree Campaign, Ethiopia has planted more trees than any other nation – some 700
million in the last few years. Tewolde Egziabher, head of the country's Environmental
Protection Authority, says that the combination of tree planting and development of organic
farming has started to greatly improve the condition of rural communities in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>China, too, has undertaken very large-scale tree planting schemes, talking of a ‘Great Green
Wall.’ It has established 24 million hectares of new forests and natural forest regrowth – an
area the size of the UK – to transform previously denuded landscapes, particularly in major
watersheds, and has been able to offset some 21 percent of its fossil fuel emissions in 2000.
28</p>
<p>There are also major success stories from South America: Cuba has done much tree
planting. Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, just 13.4 percent of the country was covered
by trees. In the last 50 years the government's planting program has nearly doubled the
national forest cover to some 25 percent. According to FAO, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile and
Costa Rica are the four Latin American countries that have implemented very successful
reforestation efforts. 29</p>
<p>These examples are heartening, but much, much more needs to be done. Balancing forest
protection and renewal, and philanthropy and profit, new ways must be found to safeguard
and enhance the condition of the biosphere, the greatest climate regulation system we have
at our disposal.</p>
<p>Expanding bio-carbon sequestration projects beyond a few pilot schemes requires key
measures: such as security of tenure, assured funding streams, political stability and
institutional capacity. International carbon projects effectively represent an emerging market
opportunity. Only those countries that are well prepared will be able to fully take advantage of
this. 30</p>
<h4>Farming carbon</h4>
<p>The earth’s major natural sinks of CO2 are oceans, forests and, perhaps most importantly,
soils. The global soil carbon pool is estimated to amount to 2,500 Gt (gigatons), whereas the
biotic (vegetation-based) pool is 560 Gt 31 . What are options for carbon sequestration via
soil renewal?</p>
<p>A new international climate treaty needs to cast its net much wider than the Kyoto Treaty as
regards bio-carbon sequestration. In addition to the inclusion of reforestation and forest
conservation, soil carbon storage should be included as an eligible carbon sink. In fact, the
IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report in 2007 indicated that carbon sequestration by improved
soil management holds very significant mitigation potential. Whilst soils hold less carbon per
hectare than forests, the carbon storage potential resulting from improved farming practices
is very large indeed.</p>
<p>The world’s total agricultural area is about 5 billion hectares, one billion more than for forests.
Of this, about 1.5 billion ha (30 percent) is arable land and land under permanent crops, and
the remaining 3.5 billion ha is permanent pasture. In addition, there are also up to 2.5 billion
ha of rangelands.</p>
<p>Soils naturally contain large amounts of carbon, derived from decayed vegetation. But the
last few decades have seen a dramatic loss of top soil, soil carbon and inherent soil fertility
due to unecological farming methods, and the one-way traffic of food supplies from rural
areas to cities without the return of carbon back to farmland where the food was grown. An
FAO report states that: “most agricultural soils have lost anything between 30 and 75 percent
of their antecedent soil organic carbon pool, or a total of 30 to 40 t C ha. Carbon loss from
soils is mainly associated with soil degradation … and has amounted to 78+/- 12 Gt since
1850. Thus, the present organic carbon pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their
potential capacity. … Considering all greenhouse gases, the global technical mitigation
potential from agriculture is between 1.5 and 1.64 gigatonnes of carbon equivalent per year
by 2030. Soil carbon sequestration is estimated to contribute about 89 percent to this
mitigation potential”. 32</p>
<p>All over the world soil and soil carbon (humus) is disappearing through erosion and through
harvesting crops that end up being consumed in distant cities. In recent years there has been
much talk about the world approaching ‘peak oil’, but perhaps even more importantly we
have actually passed the point of 'peak soil' decades ago. All over the world topsoil is being
lost on a massive scale. Says Professor David Pimentel of Cornell University: "Soil erosion is
second only to population growth as the biggest environmental problem the world faces. Yet,
the problem, which is growing ever more critical, is being ignored because who gets excited
about dirt?" 33</p>
<p>We urgently need international policy measures to restore soils to their previous levels of
fertility and water holding capacity and to stop the ongoing release of carbon stored in soils,
the world's second largest carbon sink, and potentially the world’s most effective carbon
capture and storage system.</p>
<p>The impacts of soil erosion and carbon loss on world food production have been masked to
some extent by an ever-greater array of technologies used in farming which have produced
higher yields – however unsustainably derived. But now we need to find ways to sequester
much more carbon from the atmosphere by developing bold initiatives on renewing the
world’s living systems, including life in the soil. It is time to find ways of replacing the one-way
linear systems of resource depletion, consumption and pollution that have prevailed in the
recent past with circular systems which can replenish nature and assure a sustainable
human existence on earth.</p>
<p>It is becoming apparent that the restoration of wastelands, degraded or desertified soils and
ecosystems can dramatically enhance soil organic carbon content and soil quality. Such
management practices include –</p>
<ul>
    <li>organic farming</li>
    <li>conservation tillage</li>
    <li>application of mulch, manure and compost</li>
    <li>use of cover crops</li>
    <li></li>
