                <h3>The Gaia Atlas of Cities</h3>
                <h4>This summary of my book, 'The Gaia Atlas of Cities, New Directions for Sustainable Urban
                    Living', Gaia Books, was published in the Independent on 19 May 1993.</h4>
                <p>
                In the Amazon, in the coffee plantations of Kenya and in the hills of Darjeeling start the
                supply lines of the Europe's great cities, Paris, London, Frankfurt.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The insatiable hunger of cities was brought home powerfully to me in the Eighties when I
                was working as a documentary film-maker in Latin America. In the Amazon, I saw huge areas
                of tropical forest incinerated and converted into cattle ranches. I encountered armies of
                displaced people digging up bauxite, tin and gold in mines deep in the forest. I saw huge
                stacks of mahogany cut from virgin rainforests. Piled up in ports like Belem, where were all
                these 'goods' going? Crates were stamped with the legends 'London', 'Paris' and those of
                other leading European cities.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Cities consume the bulk of the world's output. Look at Paris, a great and beautiful city, but,
                like its siblings and rivals, it is a vast transformer of resources gleaned from across the globe
                to be processed into consumer products and services, forever finding new ways of
                stimulating appetites, whether in terms of stylish restaurants or modish art galleries.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the process, Paris and London, driven by consumerism and by an insatiable desire to
                move onwards and upwards, pile up mountains of rubbish and spew billions of tons of
                waste gases into the atmosphere. In the summer months they are wrapped in a veil of toxic
                haze, from power station and factory chimneys, and from the exhausts of cars and lorries on
                their streets, and on the motorways that link them to a network of lesser and rival cities.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                With half the world's population now urban dwellers, the fate of the environment depends
                on the future development of the city - the way it functions, the way it is planned and built,
                the way it relates to the rest of the world. The issue is not to retreat from it, as so many
                ecologically minded people used to believe, but to change it. Some people see the city as a
                monster - and it often behaves like one - but it is here to stay.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Cities, whatever their faults, are stimulating: places of a rich cultural mix, and of political and
                social freedoms. When I first arrived in London in the early Sixties I was astounded to meet
                people from all parts of the world in one place. Yes, there were tensions, even riots, yet in
                Notting Hill, where I settled and helped to run the first carnivals, a new global culture was in
                the making.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Unlike many of my friends at that time, I did not travel to the corners of the earth for new
                experiences. I did not need to. I was intrigued just listening to the stories of people newly
                settled in London: tales from Nigeria, Sri Lanka and India. The city appeared to be giving
                something back to some of the peoples from whose places it had drawn its resources from.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We need to assess our cities not only by their cultural output, but also by the implications
                they have for the environment. We need a clearer understanding of how to reduce their
                dependence on global resources.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Cities will always be centres of trade, but how can that trade be conducted within the
                framework of sustainability? The onus on us now is to make the city work responsibly, so
                that what it consumes in terms of energy and resources, it gives back in ecological terms: we
                need to audit the city.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Urban people - citizens - with their command of the world's resources, are particularly well
                placed to assess their impact on the biosphere. Will they take responsibility for the global
                impact of their culturally rich lifestyles? Can they initiate an urban ecological culture?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It is here that planners, architects and urban authorities have a crucial new role. There is
                now plenty of evidence that cities can dramatically improve their environmental
                performance. The starting point is an analysis of the urban metabolism, with its input of raw
                materials and output of wastes. Can we account for the full environmental impact of cities?
                Can we change and redesign the way they work?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Economists have recently developed new tools for environmental accountancy. One of
                these is quantifying the role of cities in the context of 'GND' - annual 'gross national
                damage'. In Germany, GND has been assessed at some 6 per cent of GNP, or around DM 100
                bn (£ 42 bn) a year. This includes damage to national forests caused by air pollution, ground
                water contamination, soil degradation and corrosion damage to buildings. Much of this is
                due to the waste discharges of cities. Using such analytical tools, substantial efforts are now
                being made to move towards greater urban sustainability.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Take energy. In Holland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, 200 cities and towns have
                formed a 'Climate Alliance', committed to reducing their fossil fuel consumption by 50 per
                cent by the year 2010. This exceeds by far the commitments towards greater energy
                efficiency made by their governments. Such a dramatic commitment to urban energy
                conservation requires a major rethink of our approaches to both energy supply and energy
                consumption, involving engineers, architects, transport planners, as well as householders.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                London, with 7 million people in 1993, needs the energy equivalent of a supertanker full of
                oil twice a week, year-in, year-out. At the other end of the equation, it blows some 180,000
                tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every day. Only a dramatic increase in energy
                efficiency of its buildings and transport systems, and the supply of energy from renewable
                resources such as the widespread use of solar energy and wind power, could help to make
                London's energy supply sustainable in the medium term. A study in Berlin, with a similar
                climate, has shown that 30 per cent of its current electricity consumption could be supplied
                from the solar-panels installed on the city’s roofs.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Beyond the issue of energy, it is the broader understanding of the functioning of cities that
                is of key importance. Modern cities are the home of the 'amplified man', in whom biology
                and technology merge almost indistinguishably. We are both man and machine, apparently
                unable to function without motors or wheels. Our biological requirements - food, water, air
                - and technological ones – lorries, cars, washing machines, hi-fis - all have their own
                environmental implications. Food wastes, aluminium cans, glass bottles and plastic bags are
                all mixed in one unmanageable, sticky mess, and to disentangle this is a massive
                undertaking.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Other European capitals, such as Rome and Madrid, have developed much clearer
                perspectives of the alternatives. Rome has now achieved virtually total recycling of its
                wastes. The British government's obsession with deregulating the infrastructure of our cities
                is ecologically damaging, because it undermines concerted city-wide efforts to tackle a
                problem that spreads from Piccadilly Circus to the heart of the Amazon. Only concerted
                action, democratically organised, can make sense.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Architecture, too, has a major role to play in reducing the environmental impact of cities.
                Architects may have to re-examine their role in the urban scene. Their cherished concept of
                building monuments of wilful inventiveness may have to give way to design in the service of
                ecological sustainability.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Ecological design means minimising the environmental impact of buildings during use. They
                can be made to run on a minimum of heating or cooling, whatever the prevailing climate.
                Low-conductivity building materials, super insulation, the use of solar energy, hi-tech metal-
                coated glass and high-efficiency lighting systems are available for all buildings, new and
                existing. Who will make these the standard requirements for contemporary architecture?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                None of these requirements means that we need turn the clock back in terms of design. An
                ecologically sound building does not have to look tweedy, or borrow its form from past
                styles. Architects like Norman Foster or Richard Rogers are working at the cutting edge of
                ecologically responsible design as they conceptualise sophisticated new buildings for the
                turn of the century. Many of the most interesting ecologically responsible buildings in recent
                years have come from architects and engineers working at the leading-edge of engineering
                and technology. By comparison, many of London's old buildings are very unsound from an
                ecological point of view; poorly insulated, they waste energy.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                However, to make our cities sustainable in the long term requires much more than
                improvements to the environmental performance of buildings. Culturally we need to
                develop a new concept of the city: The urban mind map can no longer stop at the city limits.
                The tentacles of our cities stretch around the globe.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Understanding this may change the way we view our cities, as places where culture is as
                much about the ecological implications of city living as about art and architecture, theatre
                and music, food and recreation. Cities are here to stay, but we should assure that they
                function efficiently without further damaging the earth’s ecosystems: Paris, London and
                Frankfurt in balance with the Amazon.
