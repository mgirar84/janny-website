                <h3>Earthrise</h3>
                <h4>From the 4 th chapter of my book ‘Earthrise’, Paladin, 1992</h4>
                <p>It was 7 September 1988. Brasilia was celebrating Independence Day. Hundreds of
                thousands of people were lined up along the central boulevard, Avenida Luis Vargas: black,
                brown and white, shoeshine boys, office clerks, government officials and street vendors. On
                their separate stand, away from the crowds, stood army officers, decorated for wars they
                had never fought. The president himself in his ceremonial uniform saluted his troops. Brass
                bands were playing rousing music as tanks and armoured vehicles rumbled by on the
                asphalt and fighter planes and helicopters flew in formation overhead, releasing multi-
                coloured smoke. There was a carnival atmosphere as the people, once again, celebrated
                Brazil's independence from the country's former colonial masters, the Portuguese. Small
                children, sitting on their fathers' shoulders, were waving green and yellow paper flags with
                one hand and eating pink ice cream with the other under the burning sun.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But, meanwhile, so I had been told, the people in the Amazon were celebrating
                Independence Day in a rather different manner. I wanted to find out how. I was on my way
                to the Amazon to film a Channel 4 documentary called ‘Jungle Pharmacy.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Early the next morning, I clambered into a Brazilian-made Bandeirante passenger plane to
                fly to the interior. As soon as the small two-engine plane climbed into the sky the air around
                us was hazy. There was a veil of smoke between ourselves and the dry land below, which
                was the cerrado, the savannah country in the heart of Brazil where emus had roamed for
                time immemorial. Every so often it was criss-crossed by a small river. Strange green circles
                were dotted across the landscape. They were irrigated fields of soya beans and sugar cane,
                my neighbour told me; the land of the emus was becoming farming country.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                A steward emerged from the cockpit and offered us little plastic cups of sweet coffee,
                cafezinho. He climbed across boxes and baby cots that protruded into the gangway. In
                addition to the coffee he also passed around feather headdresses and other tokens of
                indigenous culture for us to buy as souvenirs. The fifteen passengers were an intriguing
                assortment of nursing mothers, beefy timber merchants, adventurer types and journalists.
                We communicated as best we could against the drone of the engines of the unpressurized
                plane. Most people spent their time reading spy novels or sleeping, but I was horribly
                fascinated by the scene below.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The landscape had changed from cerrado to tropical forest. Great columns of smoke were
                rising into the sky right across the land, from horizon to horizon. Large areas of forest down
                there belonged to cattle ranchers now, and the new owners had celebrated yesterday's
                Independence Day by setting patches of it alight; the 7 th September had been designated as
                the day for the start of the queimadas, the Amazon forest fires.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                From the plane some large fires were now clearly visible, but as we flew deeper into the
                interior, the yellow smoke lay thick as a London smog below us. We could no longer see the
                land, only the contours of hills rose up through the thick blanket from time to time. My
                neighbour told me that people were clearing land for cattle, for coffee, for sugar cane and
                for soybeans. Brazil needs to develop, he said, forests are in the way. The sooner they are
                gone, the better. Isn't that what you did in Europe, in America? Isn't that the way to make a
                civilization?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                After three hours in the air, it was time to land at our first stop-over, some nameless small
                town carved out of the jungle by loggers, cattle ranchers and gold-diggers. As we made our
                descent we could see nothing but smoke until we neared the ground. As we landed, there
                trees were burning like giant torches right next to the dirt airstrip. They looked as though
                they had been set ablaze just to mark the runway. It was a crazy, sickening sight.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Back in the air on our way to Redencao I could not believe the scale of what was happening
                below us. The forests were burning everywhere. The smoke became so thick it penetrated
                even the cabin of the plane. Some of the passengers started coughing and there were tears
                running down their cheeks, their eyes burning with the acrid smoke. These were not tears of
                anger about such immeasurable destruction of the forest below us; most people did not
                seem overly concerned, except when one of the babies almost seemed to choke. The pilot
                climbed as high as he could, given the plane's lack of a pressure cabin, up and away from the
                smoke. I tried to read a book but I could not concentrate. It was a truly nightmarish scene.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                After another couple of hours, it was time to land again. The plane took another dive down
                through the smoke, down into the burning forest to unload men and boxes at a frontier
                town called Conceiccao do Araguaia. What was their business here? Were they cattle
                ranchers who had ordered their men to set even more of the forest ablaze? Were they on
                their way to stake out a mining claim?
                <br></br>
                One more take-off and we were on our way to our final destination, Redencao, another
                hour's flight. The smoke was thicker than ever and I went into the cockpit to ask the pilot
                whether he'd seen it as bad as this before. He stared at the inquisitive foreigner, but was
                polite and helpful, nevertheless. Yes, he said, he had, but not for hour after hour like today.
                He still remembered when this was just a sea of green, with only the occasional Indian
                village in a jungle clearing. But the Amazon was changing. We had taken seven hours to get
                here, including our time on the ground. The air had been thick with smoke all the way. No, it
                wasn't fun flying in the Amazon these days, he said. It was getting too dangerous, there was
                too much smoke. Too many people were burning too much forest.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The pilot excused himself. After all, he had a plane to fly. And now he was diving down
                through the smoke once more on our approach to the airstrip at Redencao. But there was a
                problem – he could not find it in the smoky air. He circled and crossed through it and back,
                flying as low as he could, but there was no airstrip in sight, only burning trees and land on
                fire. This was truly a nightmare landscape, an inferno of unbelievable proportions. Anger
                was welling up inside me such as I had never felt before. We were witnessing an ecological
                holocaust, right there a few hundred feet below us, and what could we do about it, except
                observe it, take pictures of it and try to tell the world? The Earth's greatest storehouse of
                plants and animals was being incinerated as though it was no more than a pile of dry logs.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Later, I was to learn that in those few weeks of September 1988 some fifty million acres of
                forest and grassland were on fire, some 10 per cent of Brazil's Amazon region. Back in
                London I phoned an American astronaut, Dick Covey, who had been circling the Earth in the
                American space shuttle during those days. He told me that the whole of South America was
                covered by a blanket of smoke. Nobody, no pilot, no astronaut, nobody in the world had
                ever seen anything like it.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                At last our pilot found the airstrip. We dived through the smoke to a nerve-racking but
                perfect landing. We had arrived. As I drove through Redencao, the town was so thick with
                smoke that the taxi driver had to put the headlights on, even though it was early afternoon.
                There was a concert of car horns in the streets of this Wild West town as drivers made sure
                to avoid each other. They were driving through this infernal landscape as if blindfolded.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The other members of the film crew were waiting in a small hotel. They had gone ahead in
                another plane. For hours we talked about nothing but the gigantic fires and the smoke-filled
                landscape. We had intentionally come here at the time of the queimadas, but what we were
                seeing was obscene beyond imagining.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Redencao was a frontier town straight out of a Wild West movie, Brazilian style. Most of the
                houses were nailed together from wooden planks. Only in the centre were there stores,
                bars and large villas that had a sense of concrete permanence about them. The people
                walking the streets did not give the impression that they were perturbed by the smoke.
                Even the few Indians we met seemed unconcerned, going about their normal business.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Next day, as we drove out of Redencao, we could see the transformation the Amazon
                landscape was going through, a transformation quite deliberately planned by the Brazilian
                generals over twenty years previously. Wherever the road led, trees were being cleared on
                both sides. There was smouldering forest everywhere, stumps of trees grotesquely
                projecting up out of the ash-covered soil.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Some standing trees were still burning, with flames shooting out of the branches high up in
                the sky. An eerie silence was interrupted only by the sound of explosions, as pockets of air
                expanded and tree trunks burst. Here and there cattle with humps were wandering about
                aimlessly in the blackened landscape, looking for grass. The fence posts on their pasture had
                burned down and they had escaped, clearly bewildered by the fires and the smoke. One was
                limping badly, her hoof apparently singed. Up in the sky, groups of screeching parrots were
                flying about where only a couple of days ago there had been the crowns of trees, fruit trees,
                nesting trees. But they were gone, reduced to ashen traces on the smouldering soil.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And all of this devastation had been wreaked in the name of development. 'Land for people
                for people without land', that was the government slogan that started it all. But there was
                not much evidence of peasants and small farms. The last great untouched forest region on
                earth was being turned into a giant cattle ranch. Never mind that the thin soil was not really
                suitable for grass. And never mind that the land, when it was still forest, had actually been
                inhabited by people, other people, forest people who had been living here for tens of
                thousands of years. Oh, but they were 'primitive' people, weren't they? They were not
                worthy of survival in a new world of chain saws and sawmills, refrigerated trucks and
                hydroelectric dams.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Out of the smoke a small town emerged, made up only of huts nailed together from
                mahogany planks, one of hundreds like it across Amazonia. Gold had been found and people
                had flocked in from far and wide. They were mostly men, mostly young men with haggard
                faces looking with suspicion as the minibus full of gringos stopped outside a bar. What were
                we doing here, anyway? Inside, beer sold at two dollars a bottle and plenty of it was being
                drunk. A few of the men had mouths full of gold teeth, and fat bellies. They were drinking
                spirits, and looked at us even more suspiciously than the rest. One of them pulled a handful
                of small nuggets out of his pocket. Did we want to buy some gold? No thanks, we are only
                passing through.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The road was full of deep holes and the suspension of the minibus was less than adequate,
                not to mention the steering. The driver proceeded, nevertheless, as though he were on a
                racetrack and we held our breath each time we crossed one of those narrow tree-trunk
                bridges. In several places, smouldering forest giants were lying across the dirt road and we
                had to screech to a halt. Since it was impossible to move them and as we had no time to
                wait until they had turned into ash, we were forced to cut holes in the cattle fence with wire
                cutters, and to drive over the ash-filled pasture until the dirt road was passable again.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Suddenly there was a chain across the road and a sign announcing the Gorotire Indian
                Reserve. A man came out of his hut, an Amerindian with long black hair. He was wearing
                shorts and a T-shirt like the Indians we had seen in Redencao. He was on guard duty. After
                we had explained that we had come to film with the Kayapo, he went back to the hut to
                consult with another man. Then he dropped the chain and let us through.
                The road narrowed and became more winding. Soon we realized we had come to a different
                world. Here, for the first time on our journey, we saw the colour green. There were tall trees
                and it was shady and quite cool. Trees covered in vines, orchids and all kinds of epiphytes
                rose up on both sides of the track. No two trees seemed alike. Birds were singing and flying
                about, howler monkeys were shouting at us. There was still smoke in the air, but for the first
                time for hours there were no fires.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Gorotire is a village made up of modern brick houses. It was not arranged in a circle like
                traditional Indian villages, but had been built along a central track. The Kayapo in Gorotire
                live in a world somewhere between ancient and modern. They still wear feather head-
                dresses, but they also wear white man's clothes. They still paint their faces and bodies, but
                their brightly coloured glass beads are imported from Czechoslovakia.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Kayapo greeted us with generous smiles. I had met some of them in Brasilia. The three
                Gorotire chiefs, Kanhok, Ute and Totoi, and some of the village warriors had been active in
                the campaign for proper constitutional rights for all Indians. They had stayed in a mission
                school in the capital and had been driven to the House of Parliament every day to
                participate at a convention to draw up a new constitution for the country. They had even
                led lobby discussions, determined at long last to be granted full rights of citizenship in their
                own country. They had done so in their unique style, chanting and dancing outside
                parliament clad in their jungle best, their heads dressed in multi-coloured parrot feathers.
                They had looked magnificent in the air-conditioned lobby of the Hilton Hotel, in a world
                usually inhabited only by men in grey lightweight suits.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Now, in Gorotire, they greeted us with great warmth. They had been expecting us. We were
                invited to the men's house and I was given a chance to explain the purpose of our visit to
                everybody. The documentary we were making was concerned with the Indians' knowledge
                of the forest and its medicinal plants. Our purpose was to ascertain whether the Indians
                really were the great experts in forest ecology and in medicinal plant remedies they were
                reputed to be by some anthropologists.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Beptopup, the shaman we had come to film with, did not live in one pf the modern houses.
                He preferred a traditional straw and mud hut away from the centre of the village. He
                welcomed us with the detached curiosity of an old man who had seen many changes in his
                life. He had the silver-haired looks of a Harvard professor, but he also wore large hoops of
                glass beads in his ears.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The evening was for dancing and celebrations in which the whole village took part. We were
                fed a delicious meal consisting of fish, bananas and manioc, steamed in banana leaves. But
                somehow we were not in a party mood after seeing all those fires: they had reached to
                within fifteen miles of Gorotire.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The next morning, we got our equipment ready to film with Beptopup, who had said he
                would take us take us downriver into the forest to show us his medicinal plant garden. Dr
                Elaine Elisabetsky, director of the school of ethno-pharmacology at Belem University, had
                visited Beptopup many times before to learn about his use of forest plants. She brought
                Beptopup and his granddaughter down to the boat. For half an hour we canoed down the
                Fresco River along banks covered with tall trees. The water was not crystal-clear, as one
                would expect, but brown with soil from a nearby gold mine. After half an hour in the canoe,
                we stopped at a small landing stage.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We followed Beptopup along a narrow forest path. He walked like a young man as he
                ducked below branches, picking the leaves of plants and wild passion fruit dangling off the
                trees. The forest interior was full of the sorts of plants that decorate living rooms back home
                in London or New York: cheese plants, wild pineapple, heliconias, all kinds of orchids, plants
                with beautifully coloured leaves, and what we call ‘rubber plants’. They are at home in the
                moist shade of the forest, which has a constant temperature of some twenty-six degrees
                centigrade all the year round. The forest is surprisingly cool, but once it is removed, the
                daytime temperature shoots up to thirty-five or forty degrees under the fierce tropical sun.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Beptopup was in the world he had always known, the forest world of his ancestors. It just
                happened to be one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. But as anthropologists had
                established, he and his people knew virtually every living thing in their familiar world. In
                fact, ehnobiologists from European and American universities who had studied his
                knowledge, and that of other shamans of Amazonian tribes, had found that they had a
                name for every plant in the forest and a use for most. And why not? The Amerindians have
                been in the Amazon for tens of thousands of years, plenty of time to experiment with the
                use of plants for food and medicine.

                <br></br>
                One does not need scientific instruments to learn about the world; our senses; the capacity
                of our six senses and the knowledge systems passed on from generation to generation will
                do. Now, at the very moment that many of the forest tribes had been almost wiped out,
                people are beginning to realize that these are not 'primitives', but world experts on the
                fauna and flora of the rainforest who have a great deal to teach humanity if we want to
                utilize the biological resources of the living forest intelligently.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Beptopup understood that we had not come with chain saws and bulldozers like white men
                usually do, but that our film camera was there to record his forest science and to show the
                world how his knowledge was profoundly relevant to humanity. Many plants have medicinal
                uses yet to be explored by modern science. We had not come to tell him and his people
                what to do, but to listen and to learn. Beptopup's profound familiarity with the world
                around him was amply illustrated as we walked along together through the green shade of
                the forest. He unselfconsciously spoke with his granddaughter, Bekwaiti, quietly touching
                and teaching her the names of plants we encountered on our way deeper and deeper into
                the jungle.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                After an hour's walk we reached his forest garden. American ethnobiologist Dr Darrell
                Posey, who spent much time in Gorotire, had told us that it was here that Beptopup had
                lived for many years of his life with his wife and children away from the village. In the 1960s
                his fellow tribesmen had threatened to kill him because he could not come up with
                medicines against the new diseases the white men had brought to the village and which
                were decimating the Kayapo. He, the shaman and medicine man, was expected to know
                how to cure all diseases known to them, but now he had no medicines against new diseases
                like flu, meningitis, TB, whooping cough, measles, polio and virulent strains of malaria. It had
                all happened so suddenly and there was no time to experiment with forest medicines.
                Beptopup decided to escape from the anger of his people and to live away from the village.
                And so he packed his bags and hammock, and he and his wife and children moved away ·
                deep into the forest.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Some seven years later, he left his forest garden and went back to the village so that his
                children could be named in the proper ceremony. The tribe welcomed him back because he
                knew plant remedies that would stop the women from having babies. Many women did not
                want babies any longer, they said, because the white man was taking the land away from
                them. They did not want to live in a world without forests, without shade, without birds and
                monkeys. Could he come and administer the contraceptive remedies?
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And Beptopup stayed in the village and gave the women the seeds of a particular orchid,
                and a brew made from the bark of a special tree, and for many years few babies were born
                in the village. Cattle ranchers burned more and more of the forest nearby and gold-diggers
                came and carved deep holes in the ground and dumped sludge full of mercury in the Fresco
                River. The fish were poisoned and people became ill from swimming in the muddy water.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But the Kayapo, unlike other tribes in the Amazon, were warriors. One day they decided
                they were no longer going to be messed around, that they would rather die than lose their
                forests and their dignity. After years of suffering, they took their destiny in their own hands.
                They brought warriors together from several other villages and one day in 1985 they
                stormed the gold miners' camp. With war clubs and spears and a few guns they drove the
                miners into a large shed and locked the doors. They then radioed the Brazilian government
                and insisted on having their land demarcated before they would release the miners. And
                they wanted it – now!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                And that is what actually happened: within a few days the Brazilian government, after years
                of inaction, flew in land surveyors and actually demarcated the Gorotire reserve. The
                Kayapo chiefs negotiated for a share of the gold mine, since they knew they could not get
                rid of it. After contracts were formally signed, the miners were released by the warriors,
                who went back to their villages. For the first time in years the Kayapo had some control over
                their own destiny and could be more optimistic about the future. Today there are many
                children again in Gorotire. And at night around the camp fires, they are often told the
                stories of the great victory of the Kayapo over the gold miners and the government.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Beptopup's forest garden was an outcrop of granite rocks several hundred metres across. In
                the cracks between the rocks, soil had accumulated and this is where he had planted his
                medicinal plants, remedies his people had used successfully for millennia. He proudly
                showed us several specimens of an orchid that he had planted (its botanical name
                Epistephium lucidum), whose seeds he used as the contraceptive he had administered to
                the women. He insisted: 'Women who take this will have no more babies, no more babies at
                all. It dries up their wombs, it dries them up completely.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The use of the seeds of this particular orchid as a contraceptive has been confirmed by
                several anthropologists and one missionary who worked with the Kayapo, though their
                contraceptive action had not yet been tested scientifically. But weeks after we left Brazil, at
                the pharmacology institute of the University of Chicago, we were able to film a research
                student, Karen Lowell, who was testing another contraceptive remedy which Peruvian and
                Ecuadorian Indians call piri-piri. The grass-like plant had turned out to have a definitive
                contraceptive effect in trials with laboratory mice. Research into this and other Amazonian
                contraceptive remedies continues. Meanwhile pharmaceutical institutes and companies
                across the world are screening thousands of tropical forest plants every year for their
                medicinal efficacy.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Knowledge of plant medicines used by Amerindians is passed on verbally from generation to
                generation. Tribal people like the Kayapo know that it is the old people who are the best
                teachers for the young. All children learn some of the ancient plant knowledge as they grow
                up, but only a few, like Beptopup, become specialists whose comprehensive knowledge is
                greatly cherished. The appearance of the white man and his new diseases and new
                medicines caused so much confusion and uncertainty. Now, shamans like Beptopup have
                new pupils: ethnobiologists like Dr Darrell Posey who have made tribal knowledge of plants
                and animals the focus of their research. He has written more than a hundred scientific
                papers on the Kayapo knowledge system.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                This is what he told us: 'Beptopup for many years has been my guide and my teacher. The
                gap between our cultures is very large and he has been very patient with me. I think he is
                aware of the fact that his is the last generation with that degree of knowledge. I have come
                to realize that his is a systematic knowledge which has developed for thousands and
                thousands of years. It is very rich indeed. Yes, it is science, and a very complex one at that. It
                is, in fact, a testable knowledge. If we find that it works we can integrate it into our own
                scientific context.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Kayapo, who I have studied with, do have plants for controlling fertility, which as we
                know is an enormous issue all over the planet. But this also raises an ethical issue: we have
                to find ways to compensate native peoples for the knowledge of medicinal plants which
                they are contributing. I don't think that we can ethically exploit this knowledge without
                proper rewards. If we did that it would be nothing more than a form of neo-colonialism, in
                which we are taking their science, mass-producing it without giving benefits to the native
                people who are the guardians of that knowledge.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                A couple of days after filming in Beptopup’s forest garden, we flew him and his wife to an
                area outside the Kayapo reserve which had once been their own territory. Now it was by the
                side of a road full of timber lorries on the edge of a cattle ranch. But Beptopup still
                recognized the land he had not been back to for fifty years. There were still patches of forest
                left and Darrell wanted to show us how its species composition was, partly, the result of
                human presence. The Indians do not leave stone monuments in areas of forest they once
                inhabited, they leave a modified composition of trees with more fruit and nut trees than
                areas of 'natural' forest. Such patches of 'modified' forest are clearly identifiable if one flies
                over the jungle.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Down on the ground, Beptopup started reminiscing about the Kayapo village that once,
                many years ago, existed in this part of the forest. He pointed out medicinal plants that the
                villagers had planted on the edge of the forest and which were still there. He told us that
                they were remedies for treating boils, coughs, diarrhoea, and fungal skin diseases. Then, as
                we stopped filming, we noticed that his wife, Kukein-Kudjai, a woman in her late sixties, had
                vanished. Soon we saw her right at the top of a Bacaba palm tree, where she was harvesting
                the bunches of fruit, much to the delight of her husband, who then started making a basket
                from the palm leaves.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Only a few hundred yards further on, we stumbled up on a smouldering stretch of forest
                that had been set alight the day before. Beptopup walked around among the blackened
                stumps in anger and bewilderment, shaking his head again and again. Then he said: 'Why
                must the white man always destroy everything? Why does he never plant anything? The
                white man doesn't like the forest, but the forest is good, the forest looks after us. Why does
                the white man burn the forest and destroy the trees? Where are the turtles going to live,
                and the birds? How are my children going to live? What are they going to eat? Where will
                they get their medicines from? Why does the white man hate the forest so much? ... I have
                said all I want to say, I want to leave.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In summer 1989, I was back in the Amazon to film another documentary for Channel 4 in
                London, ‘Halting the Fires’. This time our purpose was to find out if and how the Amazon
                forest holocaust might be stopped.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Never before had the assault on rainforests been as fierce as it has been throughout the
                1980s. In Brazil alone, an area of virgin forest the size of France has been cleared in the the
                1970s and ‘80s, some 15 per cent of Brazil's Amazon forests. This does not include the huge
                areas of forest along the Atlantic coast which vanished during the process of Brazil's colonial
                conquest. Just three per cent of the Atlantic forest remains. The rest has been annihilated
                and converted to cattle ranches, soybean farms, and coffee and sugar-cane plantations, and
                for urban development.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The massive eradication, or 'development', of Brazil's Amazon forest in recent years is the
                result of deliberate government policy, first formulated by the generals who took over in
                Brasilia in 1965. At the end of 1966, General Castello Branco unveiled his 'Operation
                Amazonia' strategy with operatic pomp: he invited 300 of his fellow generals, Brazilian and
                foreign businessmen, industrialists, bankers and planners on board the pleasure cruiser
                Rosa de Fonseca for a trip from Manaus up the Amazon. The party discussed the
                ‘modernization’ of the Amazon.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The fiscal instruments for this purpose were to be tax breaks, land concessions, trade
                incentives and all kinds of special credits for the developers. Cattle ranchers, logging
                companies and mining corporations soon took advantage of the sweeteners on offer from
                the Brazilian government. In order to facilitate the 'development', a massive programme of
                road construction was initiated. Once the bulldozers had cut deep gashes into the jungle,
                the trees on both sides could be cut or burned down. Once the forest was incinerated, grass
                seeds were spread into the ash by the same means. Often hundreds or even thousands of
                acres were ‘developed’ in one fell swoop.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The opening up of the Amazon resulted in an unprecedented boom, with land values as
                much as doubling every year. Land in the Amazon became a vehicle for capturing incentives
                and cheap credits, assuming the form of a speculative instrument rather than being an input
                into agriculture.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The ranchers, loggers and mine developers wanted the Amazon for themselves. But a
                conflict of interests developed between them and poor migrants. An environmental crisis in
                the north-east of Brazil and the mechanization of agriculture in the south of the country
                brought about a flood of peasant farmers to the Amazon in search of the promised land,
                encouraged by the government. They hoped to have their own small farm, a little house
                surrounded by mango, avocado, coconut and copuacu trees, a few pigs, a chicken and a
                cow. They wanted a field for growing subsistence crops like rice, corn, beans and manioc
                and another for cash crops such as cacao, pepper and papaya.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But the power of the big landowners, combined with lack of capital and marketing problems
                for cash crops, were the downfall of many a small settler. Some were forced to become
                cowboys on the big facendas. Others were actually employed as pistoleiros, gunslingers, by
                the big landowners, invading smallholdings in the dead of night, killing settlers or evicting
                them by threatening murder. Many failed settlers ended up digging for gold at the vast Sera
                Pelada mine or in thousands of smaller mines.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It has often been said that the soils of the Amazon are not really suitable for farming and
                that this is the cause of the failure of many settlers. Tropical soils are usually less fertile than
                the soils of the temperate zones. The main reason is the high metabolic rate of living beings
                in the moist tropical climate. In the rainforest, most trees drop a few leaves all the year
                round and as they reach the ground fungi, caterpillars or herbivores munch them up. Leaves
                are thus quickly converted back into plant food, which is then rapidly absorbed by the soil,
                to be used by the roots of trees and shrubs for new growth. Trees actually contain much of
                the fertility present in forests, and a thick layer of leaf mould never accumulates as it does in
                temperate forests. Thus tropical forest soils converted into farmland are usually deficient in
                humus, and settlers find it hard to use them for anything other than tree crops.
                The conversion of tropical forests into pasture is a particularly questionable enterprise. This
                becomes abundantly clear when one travels across the Amazon on the dirt roads that have
                been built since the sixties, as I have done for many months. There are now endless
                stretches of grassland dotted with the burnt-off remains of trees projecting starkly into the
                sky. Only very occasionally does one see a cow or, even more rarely, a buffalo. Usually the
                pastures are neatly fenced, but often the fences enclose scrubland which is neither pasture
                nor forest.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Half of the pastures established within the last twenty years or so in the Amazon are now
                abandoned. In fact, many have never actually seen a cow. Frequently, they were simply
                used by their owners to attract development subsidies and other kinds of financial support
                from the government. In twenty years from the 1970s onwards, the Brazilian government
                paid out no less than six billion dollars in such tax incentives to Brazilian landowners, much
                of it borrowed from foreign banks. In return, Brazil gained a largely unproductive area of so-
                called 'pastureland' in the Amazon, approximately the size of France. This astonishing waste
                of resources was for many years a cornerstone of Brazil's development policy. In addition to
                the devastation of the environment, other sectors of the Brazilian economy were starved of
                much-needed development capital.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The ruthless and senseless destruction of the Amazon forest throughout the 1970s and
                1980s could not be kept a secret. Films and reports about the forest holocaust soon led to
                the formation of pressure groups in Europe and the USA, focusing on the environmental
                dangers of deforestation in the tropics. Researchers discovered that much of the money
                spent on 'developing' the region was paid out by the World Bank and other development
                banks which received their funds from taxpayers in Europe and North America. But few
                taxpayers were aware how their money was being spent.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Above all, it was road construction which paved the way for cattle ranching as well as
                mining projects. The BR 364, which was cut from Cuiaba in Mato Grosso through Rondonia
                towards Rio Branco, capital of Acre, was particularly contentious. The World Bank was
                forced to reconsider its investment policy when demonstrations in Washington led to
                enquiries in the US Congress. The bank had actually ignored its own environmentalists, who
                had warned of the consequences for the virgin forest of the construction of this road. It has
                since been paved and, although there are already plenty of new potholes, the road is here
                to stay, facilitating further destruction of the forest.

                <br></br>
                The Bom Futuro mine in the state of Rondonia is a case in point. A few years ago, rich
                deposits of tin ore were discovered in this location near Ariquemes on the BR 364. Wildcat
                miners started prospecting for the ore. The first few arrived on mules, kitted out only with
                picks, shovels, sacks and rudimentary refining equipment. When the rumour started
                spreading that there were rich pickings at Bom Futuro (the 'mine of the good future'),
                thousands followed. A road was bulldozed through the forest. It is a sad irony that the
                subsequent success of wildcat mines like Bom Futuro made long-established tin mines in
                places like Cornwall in southern England uncompetitive, forcing them to close.
                Bom Futuro mine is an astonishing vista. Out of the flowering forest emerges a cratered
                moon landscape dotted with tents made of black polythene sheets covered in red dust.
                There are smouldering trees everywhere. Just a few years ago, this was virgin forest. Now
                25,000 people live here in their makeshift shelters, cutting holes into the ore-rich soil with
                their pickaxes and shovels. But, increasingly, the operation is being mechanized as the big
                companies move in. There are any number of Komatsu diggers and Mercedes-Benz lorries,
                digging up the ore and carting it to processing plants. The miners and truck drivers work
                around the clock and earn good money by Brazilian standards, but the devastation is
                appalling and the risks are high.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                There are puddles everywhere with swarms of mosquitoes. Just about everybody has
                malaria. The hospital in Ariquemes is the only one in the world that exclusively treats
                malaria cases. The hospital director explained why: 'The forest, as an organism, has a
                defence system. Its defence against devastation are enormous swarms of mosquitoes. We
                have nearly 300,000 cases of malaria annually. The devastation of the forest should be seen
                as a political issue.' While we are filming at the hospital, a lorry arrives carrying the corpse of
                a man who'd been battered to death: a miner who had died in a dispute over mining rights.
                He was one of about five people killed like that at Bom Futuro every week.

                Life in the Amazon comes cheap, for settlers, miners, rubber tappers and Indians alike. In
                this world of conquest, the original inhabitants are the biggest losers. Road building in their
                territories invariably results in disease and violent death. Wherever the bulldozers roar
                through the forests, pushing over trees and levelling hills, Indians are on the retreat. In the
                past, up to 90 per cent of any given tribe would perish soon after contact. They have no
                immunity, or indeed traditional medicines, against diseases like measles, TB, whooping
                cough, polio, meningitis or just the common cold. Until the white man arrived, flu was
                unknown here. Now it is a killer disease.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Surui chief Itabera told us: 'We never had pneumonia, measles, malaria. When we lived in
                the jungle we were healthy. After the white man came we started getting sick. One-third of
                our people have tuberculosis now. That's why we sell our trees to the sawmiller. But he
                doesn't value us. He just exploits us and our forests.' The same story is told by Indians
                throughout the Amazon. And where the Indians have not died from disease, many have died
                from bullets.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In another Amazon state, Para, we went to film the new town of Paragominas. It is located
                on another new road, the Brasilia-Belem highway. This place has been called the 'sawmill
                capital of the world'. There are some 500 mills, financed mainly with government grants.
                They slice up the thousands of trees brought every day along the web of dirt roads cut into
                the forests. A permanent smoke cloud hangs over the town from sawdust incinerators and
                charcoal kilns. Over forty species of trees are processed in the sawmills. As they are cut
                down in the forest, they tear down many other trees with them, because they are
                connected by a tangle of lianas. The degraded forest dries out much more than virgin forest,
                with the big trees no longer providing shade. Such forests are an easy prey for fires.
                Apart from providing high-quality timber cheaply, places like Paragominas also produce
                charcoal, the new boom industry in the Amazon. It is the sawmill off-cuts that are stacked
                into the charcoal kilns. The kilns are worked by resettlers from other parts of Brazil. Men
                and women earn around ten dollars a week, but the majority of the workforce are children.
                They earn little more than food money. One boy told us: 'I get up at one o'clock in the
                morning to work the whole day. We have no school, no nothing. We only suffer and work
                here. The charcoal won't let the children grow. We work and work but we hardly make any
                money.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Charcoal kilns are proliferating in Amazonia, not just ones burning sawmill off-cuts. In the
                south of Para, around Maraba, the virgin forest is being cut down to be converted directly
                into charcoal, thousands of acres every year. Some of the charcoal is used for grilling steaks,
                but most of it is actually used for smelting pig iron.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Grand Carajas project in Para is the largest iron-ore mine in the world. Brazil has run up
                a world-record debt – some 120 billion dollars – to set up new industries and new mining
                operations such as the Carajas mine. It is the richest source of iron ore in the world.
                Financed by loans from the EU, Japan and the USA, it provides the raw material for steel
                industries throughout the Western world. Our cars, fridges, washing machines, pipelines
                and iron girders are now made mostly from ore mined in Carajas, a mountain of iron first
                discovered when the compasses of planes flying over it went wild.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Brazil's state-owned mining company, Compania do Vale de Rio Doce, developed Carajas
                into a super-efficient operation. With giant diggers and 180-ton trucks imported from the
                USA the company is trying to make large profits and to earn hard currency for Brazil. Carajas
                is the name of the tribe that once lived here, but its remnants have since been settled
                elsewhere. The naked 'savages' with their bows and arrows were no match for men
                equipped with guns and giant machines.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In order to transport the ore and the pig iron from The Carajas mine, a 200-mile railway line
                was specially built to the Atlantic harbour of Sao Luis. The actual mine itself is not an
                ecological disaster area. In fact, the forests around the Carajas mine have been kept
                relatively intact. But several pig-iron smelters have now been established around the town
                of Maraba to the west and it is here that the forests are being incinerated. The trees burned
                in the kilns come into the equation at zero value, a tempting prospect. And thus the world's
                most unique flora is turned into profane charcoal to smelt iron ore. Brazil has been using
                money borrowed from our banks to destroy what is, arguably, its most precious natural
                asset, the Amazon forest, as though it were absolutely valueless. Thus rainforest trees end
                up providing us with our cars and washing machines.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Para is the easternmost state of the Brazilian Amazon. Apart from Rondonia, it is the most
                ravaged part of the Amazon forest. It is here that cattle ranching first started. And it is here
                that the largest mining operations are in place, not just for iron ore, but also for bauxite,
                manganese, copper and gold. It is in Para that huge areas of forest have been flooded by
                hydroelectric schemes, largest of all the Tucurui dam which powers Carajas and other
                mining operations. But it is also here that the resistance against further rainforest
                destruction has been fiercest.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                A new alliance between scientists, ecological activists and Indians has been forged with the
                purpose of slowing down and ending the destruction. It was a Brazilian professor, Dr Salati,
                who first pronounced that the continuing destruction of the eastern section of the Amazon
                forest could have the most severe climatic consequences. He showed that the rains that
                come in from the Atlantic first shed their moisture over the forests of Para. This rain is
                absorbed by the trees, but most of it is released again by evapo-transpiration powered by
                the hot tropical sun. The moisture rises from the steaming forests and blows westwards,
                where the clouds shed their load again and again. And so the process is repeated six or
                seven times until the clouds reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, where they are driven
                upwards by the cold mountain air. Some of them drift southwards, eventually to fall as rain
                over Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and even as far away as Europe. Others are blown
                northwards, to reach as far as Mexico and the wheat belts of the USA and Canada.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Scientists have expressed the fear that further deforestation of Para on the eastern rim of
                the Amazon forest would be disastrous. Already, there are signs that the rains are falling
                more erratically and that the dry season is getting longer. The local climate seems to be
                getting drier; the majestic Amazon clouds appear to be drifting by more and more often
                without shedding their rain. With ever more deforestation, average soil temperatures are
                rising as they have done elsewhere on the planet where trees have been cut down on a
                huge scale, as in Africa and India. At the same time, soil moisture is declining and when the
                rains do pour down there is much more rapid run-off than from land covered by the multi-
                layered canopy of trees. In deforested regions, soil erosion is severe, washing precious
                topsoil into the rivers and polluting waters that once teemed with fish.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Dr James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia theory, is convinced of the critical importance
                of the Amazon forest for sustaining the beneficial interaction between the biosphere and
                the atmosphere. He recently estimated the cash value of the environmental services of the
                Amazon to the planet. He likens the forest to a giant air-conditioner, helping to keep the
                Earth cool and moist. In a recent lecture he stated:
                <br></br>
                ‘One way to value the forest as an air-conditioner would be to assess the annual energy cost
                of achieving the same amount of cooling mechanically. If the clouds made by the forests
                reduce the heat flux of sunlight received within their canopies, by only 1 per cent, then their
                cooling effect would require a refrigerator with a cooling power of fourteen kilowatts per
                acre. The energy needed, assuming complete efficiency and no capital outlay, would cost
                annually £2,000 per acre ... On this basis, an accurate but imprecise estimate of the worth of
                the refrigeration system that is the whole of Amazonia is about £100 trillion.’
                <br></br>
                The meat yield of an acre of cleared forest temporarily converted into pasture land, by
                comparison, is equivalent to about 750 hamburgers annually, for which the rancher is paid
                about £IO.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The indigenous people of the Amazon have not been slow to respond to the realization by
                ecologists and climatologists that the maintenance of their traditional way of life had a
                respect, even a reverence, for the forest, would be a good prospect for the world. The most
                astonishing manifestation of this new allegiance was an extraordinary gathering at the small
                town of Altamira in the state of Para. It was here that yet another massive hydroelectric
                dam had reached the planning stage. The dam would have flooded land traditionally
                inhabited by the Kayapo, the Arara, the Assurini and several other Amerindian tribes. And it
                was here that the young Kayapo chief Paulinho Payakan decided to hold a very special
                meeting in February of 1989.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I had the opportunity to make a short news film about the Altamira gathering for Channel 4,
                and so to witness what turned out to be an extraordinary event.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                From all parts of the Amazon and from North America, 900 Amerindians arrived. And from
                Europe, the USA and Brazil, 400 journalists and environmentalists, turned up. The whites
                came with cameras, tape recorders and word processors. The Indians came with bows and
                arrows, with wooden clubs, colourful head-dresses, and a few brought their own video
                cameras.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The only topic on the agenda of the meeting was the future of the rainforest. The forest
                Indians, threatened with the total destruction of their familiar habitat, had decided to take
                the future in their own hands.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Never had there been such an extraordinary gathering of Brazilian tribes. The Arara,
                Xavante, Gaviao, Yanomami, Suya, Guarani, Surui, Parakana and many other tribes sent
                representatives. They came in buses, by plane and by boat up the Xingu River, all made up in
                their own distinctive feather head-dresses and body paints. As they arrived, they chanted
                their tribal songs and war cries. And the inhabitants of Altamira looked on in astonishment -
                'Watch out, the Indians are coming.' It was like a scene out of a Wild West movie, except it
                was real.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The meeting was opened by Paulinho Payakan in Altamira's crowded basketball hall. This
                young Kayapo chief had had the idea of holding the gathering. He and his helpers had
                organized it with extraordinary vigour and skill. He spoke into the microphone: 'Until
                recently, we didn't have much reason to believe that the white man would ever understand
                the Indians, our ways of thinking and living. But now we see groups of lndians and white
                people working together to save the Amazon forest.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the hall, Kayapo and Xavante warriors displayed their colourful presence, in head-dresses
                made from parrot feathers. They chanted in support of their chiefs, who gave sad and
                rousing speeches about decades of death, defending the right of the Indians to live in their
                own way in the forest, looking after it rather than destroying it. They booed the director of
                Electronorte, the electricity company that wanted to flood the forests around Altamira with
                a series of hydroelectric reservoirs the size of Belgium.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Some speakers from the ecology movement pointed out that the Amazon forest contains
                the greatest variety of plants, animals and insects anywhere on Earth. Many even today had
                only Indian names.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Others, such as Brazilian ecologist Dr Jose Lutzenberger, were more concerned about the
                effects of large-scale deforestation on the climate: 'We destroy the trees at our peril. Where
                the forest disappears and scrub or naked soil takes its place, evapo-transpiration is replaced
                by hot updraughts that dissolve incoming clouds. If the present rate of deforestation
                continues in the east, in the states of Para and Maranhiio, it could soon trigger a collapse in
                the whole system, perhaps before 30 or 40 per cent of the forest is cleared.'
                The Indian camp was in the grounds of a mission station outside the town, right on the edge
                of the forest. Young Kayapo warriors had built huts for their people from tree branches and
                palm leaves. There were Indians sleeping in hammocks, cooking fish, manioc arid bananas,
                mothers suckling their babies, their tiny faces painted red with the sap of urucum nuts. Men
                were carving wooden clubs or making baskets, little boys were playing with their pet
                monkeys, girls were threading brightly coloured beads into bracelets and necklaces, just as
                they did in the village back home.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But here they were mobbed by photographers and cameramen, who lapped up the tribal
                dancing and the bright colours of the jungle culture. They filmed these scenes as they
                themselves were being filmed by Indians using video cameras.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But in the streets of Altamira people congregated for a great counter-demonstration in
                support of the Kararao dam. The cattle ranchers had mustered the support of traders and
                settlers and they all shouted 'we want the dam, we want the dam'. They had been led to
                believe that dams mean progress and a better life. And Altamira certainly needs progress:
                everywhere there are holes in the roads, living conditions are atrocious and there are hardly
                any jobs to be had.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But, in the meeting, scientists stated that big dams mean trouble. The Balbina dam, near
                Manaus, in particular, only recently completed, proved that point. There were millions of
                dead trees left standing in the water. A huge area of good land had been flooded, and there
                were now few fish. New diseases like leishmaniosis were spreading like wildfire. The
                turbines were corroded by the stinking, acidic water and they produced only a quarter of
                the electricity that had been anticipated.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Indians and the ecologists pointed out that progress does not have to mean giant dams
                and enormous forest fires. Sensitive small-scale development was much more sensible than
                megaprojects. Amazonia needed a new approach to development that did not devastate the
                forests.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Indians told the Brazilian government that they would rather die than suffer further
                land loss. One old Kayapo woman, Kokumi, took the microphone, an object she'd probably
                never seen before in her life, and said this to a hushed audience: 'Listen, white man, you
                have already got plenty of land, and we, the Indians, have only little left. These are our
                lands, our waters, our forests. Our food depends on the game animals and the resources of
                the forests and the rivers. I have already many grandchildren, and their health depends on
                these things. Let us go on to live on our lands in peace.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Altamira gathering may well prove to have been a turning point in the story of the
                Brazilian Amazon. The Indians had shown that they are a political force to be reckoned with
                both within the country and well beyond the borders of Brazil. They can now, cautiously,
                count on a network of supporters that stretches as far as the US Congress, the European
                Parliament and the British House of Commons.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Indians are, at last, being recognized as guardians of the integrity of the rainforest. Their
                ancient knowledge is increasingly acknowledged as a vital contribution to scientific
                understanding. Many new important crops and products which could benefit humanity
                could be developed from rainforest plants.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                One participant at the Altamira gathering, Anita Roddick, the founder of the Body Shop
                chain, was inspired to set up a new department to investigate plant oils and dyes used by
                rainforest tribes like the Kayapo. The company decided to buy several tons of brazil-nut oil
                from the Kayapo every year, to be incorporated into new cosmetics products. A few other
                companies are now also purchasing plant products in tribal villages on a fair-trade basis
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But it is not only the Indians who are experts of the rainforest. Rubber tappers, too, use the
                forest without destroying it. Their struggle to prevent its further annihilation was
                highlighted as a result of the murder of rubber tappers' leader Chico Mendes in December
                1988. For years, he and his fellow rubber tappers and brazil-nut collectors had been fighting
                the cattle ranchers in order to prevent the conversion of forests into pasture. Mendes had
                called for the creation of 'extractive reserves' which would enable people to live by
                harvesting from the forest without killing it.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                At the Altamira gathering the forest peoples' alliance created by Indian leader Ailton Krenak
                and Chico Mendes was represented, among others, by one of his successors, Gumercindo.
                He, too, delivered an eloquent speech: 'The struggle of the rubber tappers and the people of
                the forest is, above all, a struggle for life. We have to fight for an end to the violence to
                ourselves and the forest. I think this is the movement's future: to spread across the whole of
                the Amazon region, with schools in extractive reserves that will be set up throughout; with
                health-care clinics and co-operatives to market the goods; with research centres where the
                people of the forest may develop new technologies, so that they can utilize the forest better
                without it being destroyed.'
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                To the astonishment of the forest people, the outgoing government of President Sarney
                decided in January 1990 to demarcate the first official extractive reserve in the state of
                Acre. The Upper Jurua Valley Extractive Reserve covers 500,000, forming one of the world's
                largest areas marked for environmental preservation. It contains great numbers of rubber
                and brazil-nut trees. Until recently these were exploited by rubber tappers and Indians on
                behalf of 'rubber barons' who held their workers under a system of debt bondage. Today a
                co-operative runs the reserve and guarantees acceptable living conditions for the people
                living in it.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                There has been a wind of change in the Amazon since the end of the 1980s. The forest
                peoples' movement has made sure of that, in close co-operation with their allies in Europe
                and the USA. Constant pressure from environment groups has led to major policy changes.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the summer of 1989, for the first time, the Brazilian government, having created a new
                environment agency, IBAMA, took measures to reduce the scale of the Amazon fires. For
                the first time in many years, new subsidies were no longer granted to cattle ranchers for
                expanding their ranch land by burning the forest. The government rented six helicopters,
                with which it had to monitor an area the size of Western Europe. Its forest patrols were co-
                ordinated with the photographs transmitted every day by the Brazilian space agency's
                satellite, which is able to pinpoint even the smallest fires.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Flying in one of the government helicopters over the state of Acre it was still appalling to
                see the many forest fires, some of which were evidently illegal. But most were on a small
                scale, a few dozen acres at a time rather than the gigantic fires covering thousands of acres
                we had witnessed the year before. Some of the offending landowners were fined but,
                because many of them are absentee landlords, with addresses in Rio or Sao Paulo, it was
                often difficult to enforce these fines.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                For the first time in years, there was an overall reduction in the annual forest destruction.
                But nobody should be under the impression that the destruction has been halted. Logging in
                the Amazon is on the increase as other tropical-forest countries run out of timber. A mature
                tree can be worth up to a thousand dollars standing, and more than $ 10,000 in a stack of
                planks in Belem harbour. And wherever a new logging road is cut, access for slash-bum
                agriculturalists becomes easier, encouraging predatory settlement in the virgin forest.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                At the beginning of 1990, the new president, Fernando Collor, appointed as his special
                secretary for the environment Brazil's most radical environmentalist, Dr Jose Lutzenberger.
                With the president's backing, he promised sweeping changes in the policy for the Amazon,
                emphasizing just how important these forests are for the ecological future of Brazil and,
                indeed, for the whole world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Collor administration surprised the world with an enlightened attitude to the Amazon
                and its peoples, but it remains to be seen whether these will be lasting changes. Many
                Brazilians resent foreign interference: the Amazon is there to be exploited and foreigners
                who try to prevent this are meddling in Brazil's internal affairs.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Ultimately, it is only the peoples of the Amazon themselves who can prevent the massacre
                of the forest by outsiders. Many different groups have shown extraordinary skill and
                courage in recent years and they need all the support from us they can get!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Brazil has about 60 per cent of the Amazon forest on its territory, but it extends into eight
                other countries. Of these, Colombia has a particularly enlightened forest policy. In 1990, the
                outgoing administration of President Virgilio Barco showed great imagination and far-
                sightedness by giving title to no fewer than forty-five million acres of Amazon forest to the
                country's Indians, nearly half the total area of forest in the country, four-fifths the size of
                Britain. The new Colombian policies were initiated and are now administered by
                anthropologist Martin von Hildebrand.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Colombia has taken the world lead in recognizing its obligations to its Amerindian peoples
                and in taking steps to stop the devastation of its part of the Amazon forest, which contains
                some 10 per cent of the world's plant and animal species. There are at least 50,000 species
                of flowering plants, some 1,750 bird species and 4,000 different kinds of butterflies, and
                many of these are extremely localized and still known only by Indian names.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The prospects for the Amazon forest look better than they have for a long time. After
                decades of senseless devastation, we may be heading for a period in which the
                environmental services of the Amazon forest and of its people are better appreciated.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Sadly, the same cannot, as yet, be said for the rainforests of Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma,
                Madagascar, the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Zaire and the Congo. In all these countries, the
                pressure of logging and mining companies and of settlers hungry for land in the rainforests
                is still enormous. Invariably, indigenous groups are facing the threat of annihilation as the
                forests are destroyed around them.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                According to Norman Myers, as quoted in ‘Global Warming’, ed. Jeremy Leggett, worldwide
                destruction of rainforests has recently been occurring at at an annual rate of some 1.8 per
                cent, 35.5 million acres a year or 67 .5 acres a minute. But in African countries like the Ivory
                Coast and Nigeria annual loss is presently around 15 per cent, in the Philippines and
                Madagascar over eight per cent. About 1.4 billion acres of pristine rainforests remain, less
                than half the area forty years ago, and 52 per cent of these are in just three countries: Brazil,
                Zaire and Indonesia.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Thailand's example is indicative of what could soon happen elsewhere in the tropics: in
                thirty years, its forest cover went down from two-thirds to just over a quarter, mainly
                because of export-oriented logging. With the population doubling, many deforested areas
                were taken over by slash-burn agriculturalists hungry for land. But landslides in the hilly
                uplands now frequently endanger the lives of settlers. At present, Thailand's annual forest
                loss is low, because accessible forests have all but vanished. Today, it feeds its sawmills with
                timber from Burma, contributing to that country's forest destruction.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the lowlands of Thailand, just 50,000 acres of forest are left at Khao Noi Chu chi. Despite
                its tiny size, this remnant forest contains an astonishing wealth of plant and animal species,
                including an extremely rare bird called Guerney's pitta, or jewel thrush, famed for its
                fabulous blue and yellow plumage. Once abundant, it had been thought to be extinct, but
                was rediscovered in this forest in 1986. Just fifteen to twenty pairs of the jewel thrush are
                left. It is impossible to say how many other less spectacular plant and animal species will be
                lost if this last area of lowland forest is destroyed.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Species other than humans have a right to exist. This seems an obvious point, but in recent
                decades it could not be taken for granted. Only a little over 3 per cent of the surface of the
                planet is actually legally protected, and even some of these areas continue to be
                threatened.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Flying over the canopy of the still vast Amazon forest in spring of 1990, I was awed by the
                sheer abundance and exuberance of this primeval world of trees and water. The rivers
                wound their way through the green land below us, intertwined with each other and with the
                forest like giant snakes. They were not confined for ever to permanent beds of their own. As
                they flooded their banks and changed their courses, they had left behind bits of themselves
                in the flat landscape, so-called oxbow lakes, stretches of water separated from the river of
                which they were once part.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Here and there the occasional hill rose out of the plain, the sky above it like a mountain
                landscape of enormous glacier-like clouds suspended in a stark blue sky. This part of the
                Amazon forest was bathed in glittering light, the crowns of the trees stretched out towards
                us, their myriad of leaves seeking the sun. But our helicopter was not the sun, only a noisy
                mobile observation platform for curious visitors from another world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Our pilot had been flying over the Amazon for twenty years and he was proud to show us
                his familiar world. From time to time, he dived down to just above the tree tops to get the
                birds off their nests or perches so that we could see them better. Of course, with all that
                engine noise you are unable to hear them screeching and calling out to each other. But we
                could see them rising from the trees and sailing over the forest - parrots, toucans, eagles
                and herons, some by themselves, some flying in groups.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The shapes of the trees were of an astonishing variety, the tallest ones laden with orchids
                and creepers all seeking the power of the sun. Here and there, we saw trees covered in
                mauve or yellow blossoms, but the helicopter moved on so relentlessly there was no time to
                become familiar with any single tree or bird or flower. And even the curved horizon moved
                on, like a mobile theatre set, changing minute by minute.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The Amazon is an epic landscape. Forests, rivers and sky are interwoven like a majestic
                tapestry. I knew that down there, below us, was the greatest assembly of life on Earth, ever
                changing yet ever constant, never touched by an ice age or other such traumatic event.
                Who would have thought that humans, even equipped with bulldozers and chain saws,
                would be able to get the better of such a triumphant world of nature in large parts of the
                tropics? But now, at last, we are becoming aware that our man-made world will be in peril if
                these great forests vanish. Perhaps the process of halting the destruction has at last begun.
